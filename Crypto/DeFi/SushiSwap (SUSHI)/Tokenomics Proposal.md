### Highlights
**Sushi Tokenomics Redesign**

The time has arrived for Sushi to discuss new tokenomics. An optimal token model should incentivize liquidity and promote decentralization. In addition, it should provide more equitable governance and sustainable economics. We propose a new token model that will help Sushi achieve these goals and, in addition, help bolster Treasury reserves to ensure continual operation and development.

The proposed token model is robust and offers several tried and true methods for promoting value and utility. In addition, we institute novel concepts to help promote maximum value for all stakeholders. Below is a brief tl;dr of the proposal for your convenience. We welcome your questions and feedback to help us discuss the model over the coming weeks as we plan for a productive 2023.

**Liquidity Providers (LPs)**

1.  LPs receive fee share from the 0.05% swap fee, with the bulk of the fees going to the pools producing the most volume.
2.  LPs can lock their liquidity to earn boosted, emissions-based rewards. But, they lose the rewards if removed before maturity.

**xSushi**

1.  xSushi receives emissions-based rewards in time-locked tiers. Longer locks receive more rewards.
2.  Time locks are “soft locks”; you can remove your collateral before maturity but lose all rewards.
3.  Time locks auto-renew and compound in a new time lock.
4.  xSushi receives no fee share, only emission-based rewards.

**Burns**

1.  We use a variable percentage of the 0.05% swap fee to buy back Sushi and burn it, permanently removing it from circulation. The percentage changes based on the total time-lock tiers selected.
2.  If xSushi or LPs seeking emissions-based rewards prematurely withdraw their collateral from their time locks, the rewards get forfeited and burned.
3.  Because time locks get paid after maturity, but burns happen in “real-time” when a large amount of collateral gets unstaked before maturity, it has a sizeable deflationary effect on supply.

**Locked Liquidity**

1.  We will use a portion of the 0.05% swap fee to lock liquidity for price support.

**Emissions**

1.  We introduce a nominal 1-3% APY for emissions.
2.  Our goal is to have a supply within a predictable margin that balances with buy/burns/locks.

### Takeaways

So basically they're focused on time locks, removing xSushi rewards anyways, and its all emission based rewards. Then they combine with burn mechanisms (idk why crypto stuff have this or like they think it's a good comparison to buybacks?) and locked liquidity, lol reminds of locked jewel tbh.

Next reference is to add in the Meiji governance as an example here (will need to read as well):
First look seems good since has a decrease in voting power the more tokens you hold and represents shares in a way to decrease sybiling effects
https://forum.sushi.com/t/meiji-governance-rework/11283

They next argue that Sushi has 3% amm share and 0 dex aggregation share? That doesn't seem right?? Check ttt and defillama

They are moving everything to new AMM Trident framework, can review past notes on this as seems like good decision? Provides good roi for LPs. Not sure wat they mean by protocol growth tho if the protocol is not growing with their current plans.

At Statistics now:
Ah okay so they're reasoning for taking away xSushi rewards is because the xSushi stakers don't provide liquidity. But then what is xSushi for then? If it wasn't made for stakers to provide liquidity then why should they care what xSushi stakers are doing? That's where fees are drawn from as staking=no selling right? So staked sushi isn't being sold, that lowers supply and more people want to stake sushi because of the fees earned from the protocol, less supply more demand blah blah, so then why would xSushi stakers be expected to provide liquidity? How did they prove this datapoint? Who's to say that LPs are not also xSushi stakers but in different wallets lol. Seems like a lot of bs

Emissions means more sushi printing correct?

Need someone to take a look at this part:
- Historically, the subsidized cost of liquidity was 1 Sushi for every $60 in LP value, for
an average annual cost of 5 Million Sushi in emissions to attract 300M USD in TVL.
- The cost of Sushi emissions incentives compared to Sushi Bar income is nearly 1:1. For
the 15,000 Sushi spent daily to encourage LPs, the Sushi Bar earns $14,000, and the
treasury captures $1,400, an unsustainable value extraction.
- When comparing the total cost of emissions spent to treasury income, we see the
effect of the Sushi Bar on the protocol’s financial health. 5 Million Sushi vs. 1.3 Million
income in USD value; 3.8:1 with today’s Sushi USD value, but earlier in the year, it was
significantly greater as the price of Sushi was much higher.

Okay so in reference to the previous staking rant, yes there's no time lock...but that's not a bad thing? Either you go full VE model or you allow for people to fluidly enter and exit positions, but I don't think there should be a knock for there being no time lock present.

So they mention xSushi purpose as incentivizing staked LPs. Will need to fact check that. Instead he views them as value extractors, okay but not really?

THis part for xSushi/SushiBar
1. Remove non-sticky staking terms; introduce time-locked tiers for rewards.
2. Introduce a burn mechanism to reward tiers.
3. Substitute trading fee revenue rewards with emission-based rewards.
4. Institute a penalty for withdrawing collateral before stake maturity.
