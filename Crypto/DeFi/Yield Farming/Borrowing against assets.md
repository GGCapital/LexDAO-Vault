here's some strategies i put together for ppl looking to borrow against their assets, can be done on multiple chains but this is usually how i view a new farm or strategy @Farmer @Researcher basically had a homie in our investment dao reach out for understanding whats needed to deposit Eth as collateral and borrow stables against it my basic plan, low maintenance was:

> would say use aave for eth and avax borrow lending, yearn for ftm and eth (i use for ftm), then route the stables you've received into farms on curve so deposit eth into aave ([https://docs.aave.com/faq/](https://docs.aave.com/faq/ "https://docs.aave.com/faq/")), borrow usdc, deposit usdc into 3pool or tricrypto pools earning 5-20% apr on curve finance (links below) and chill. if you wanted to be on fantom, you could use yearn to deposit your eth, borrow stables, bridge usdc over to ftm using synapse bridge, deposit usdc/usdt into more curve pools and compound some of the earnings back into yearns tricrypto pools [https://avax.curve.fi/](https://avax.curve.fi/ "https://avax.curve.fi/") [https://ftm.curve.fi/](https://ftm.curve.fi/ "https://ftm.curve.fi/") then use ze rewards for more riskier investments if needed

an additional route to take on fantom can be the following (also added in some tips here and there for new ppl):

> oh other play i've been enjoying on fantom, might be fun to add to your strategies. other reason is bc i'd also say try to avoid keeping all assets on one platform, cant find tweet but i think it was degenspartan ([https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan](https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan "https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan")) or cryptoyieldinfo ([https://twitter.com/Cryptoyieldinfo](https://twitter.com/Cryptoyieldinfo "https://twitter.com/Cryptoyieldinfo")) that said keep 10% or less of assets on each platform to reduce any protocol risks. so spreading out tokens/farms across diff protocols that you either trust or that have been vouched for is my main suggestion. ofc do so without spreading yourself too thin where you cant keep up with farms, so would advise starting up a spreadsheet before getting started on ze borrowing, bridging, depositing, farming blah blah. another degenspartan recommendation, but try not to rely on zapper ([https://zapper.fi/dashboard](https://zapper.fi/dashboard "https://zapper.fi/dashboard")), debank ([https://debank.com/](https://debank.com/ "https://debank.com/")), or other portfolio websites to keep up with assets as they might not be fully updated across newer protocols, UI glitches, whatever. can either build your own portfolio spreadsheet to your liking, or search for other peoples and copy pasta lol like this: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XtHY5pR4iVSAcTWN5QWn8-WTHEoQ2ALDIKXaPSvhQS8/edit#gid=14881429](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XtHY5pR4iVSAcTWN5QWn8-WTHEoQ2ALDIKXaPSvhQS8/edit#gid=14881429 "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XtHY5pR4iVSAcTWN5QWn8-WTHEoQ2ALDIKXaPSvhQS8/edit#gid=14881429") but anyways heres another you could try when you have stables on fantom: - depositing eth or btc into yearn finance on fantom (or eth) ([https://yearn.finance/](https://yearn.finance/ "https://yearn.finance/")) - borrowing stables against it (usdc for example) - depositing into beethoven-x stablecoin indices ([https://beets.fi/#/pool/0x6da14f5acd58dd5c8e486cfa1dc1c550f5c61c1c0000000000000000000003cf](https://beets.fi/#/pool/0x6da14f5acd58dd5c8e486cfa1dc1c550f5c61c1c0000000000000000000003cf "https://beets.fi/#/pool/0x6da14f5acd58dd5c8e486cfa1dc1c550f5c61c1c0000000000000000000003cf") this pool holds usdc, frax, ust, and fusdt - pays out 17.5% apr in these rewards) - then using the rewards for more farms, like depositing the earned Beets rewards back into the yearn finance Beets vault to earn an additional 35% - then swapping the rest of the rewards into stables and compounding back into the same or different farms
