## Eth pools
needed to go and reassess some places to toss eth, keeping it simple with some yearn pools to run thru and then will work thru other options like aeth

bascially looks like i could have simply been doing curve steth thru yearn earning 7% and rewards from crv and cvx for eth exposure

curve tricrypto for btc eth usdt exposure at 8% still lmao this was literally my bread and butter and i didnt even get back into these plays!

then using the rest to buy yfi and stake in their yfi yvault for 0.84% but main thing is yfi bussing from lows and establishes my confidence in protocol

another ideal here being that for stables, i can simply place them in iron bank and earn 8% as well thru ib3CRV tokens

another alternative is instead of just yfi, i deposit into curve yfi-eth pool for added exposure without succumbing to massive IL but still earning 4%

next goal is ofc just understanding what i would be able to withdraw once im ready to exit. is it yfi and eth im getting from the curve yfi-eth pool or sum else?

would i need to go thru all these steps to deploy first before earning this much or will zap work fine? thankfully i can learn here!!!

### st-ycrv

This is the token address for staked ycrv, I would technically want to withdraw from here and send the eth over to the gnosis address but honestly i still would need to keep it on arbitrum compared to eth unfortunately.
