## OP Background
https://blog.galxe.com/galxe-x-optimism-optimism-quests-f060c139d660

Optimism has their retroactive public goods funding program that empowers learning and other advancements for the blockchain eco

"gained notoriety for their innovative governance experiments related to their Token House and Citizens’ House."

wtf is this

mentions the Optimism Collective for this as well https://app.optimism.io/announcement

## Learn and Earn
then we go into Learn and Earn

"Users begin by entering the [Optimism Quest Hub](https://app.optimism.io/quests). Here you will be directed to read short educational content about the participating ecosystem projects. To ensure you are confident in understanding what the project does, you will then take a short quiz that will prepare you for the on-chain tasks to follow (note: passing the quiz is required to proceed and complete the tasks).

1.  **Earn**

After completing a specific project’s quiz, users will go on to accomplish the project’s on and off-chain tasks. Once users perform all specified behaviors, they will be eligible to mint the project’s special Optimism Quest NFT on their Galxe campaign page. Holding the NFT may yield immediate and/or future utility from the project(s), and furthermore, if users collect a certain total number of NFTs from all the participating Optimism Quests projects, then they will be eligible to receive unique characteristics for the upcoming Optimism NFT PFP mint."

This segment

All parts of these Quests require tokens or rely on different parts of using a protocol, for instance bridging assets over to optimism and/or

### Stargate Transfer
Stargate is a fully composable liquidity transport protocol that lives at the heart of omnichain DeFi. Stargate allows users to securely transfer assets from 6 other blockchains to and from Optimism at a minimal cost.

Even better, Stargate only requires source gas to complete transfers - no more needing gas tokens on the other side of your cross-chain transactions! Stargate is made possible by LayerZero’s messaging primitive, a core component of the future of omnichain transactions.

Questions are weak as shit tbh but ig they allow for extra learning. I sent over assets from a new wallet to Optimism but will use Stargate to bridge out.

omnichain DeFi and 7 blockchains is the answer

Remember to have gas (ETH) in your wallet before sending or making transactions

lmao i shoulda just added my wallet for this wtf

anyway, very simple process, just bridge assets over using stargate
basically bridged 105 usdc from arbitrum to optimism

Then once completing, you'll connect your wallet to Galxe to receive the Stargate OP Quest

honestly this doesnt teach you anything about the protocol, just tells you to go dump your money in some random pool wtf

i know its a quest but thats pretty stupid to advertise it as education and then not teach the new user anything

### Synapse Deposit
https://synapseprotocol.com/pools/optimismnusd

"**Task**

Deposit either $20 worth of ETH or stablecoins in Synapse’s [stableswap LPs](https://synapseprotocol.com/pools)"

lmeow just deposit into stableswap pool, claim nft, remove stables if you wish. currently earning 6.95% APR tho soooo can keep a bit as well

earning about 0.13% daily so not too shabby
