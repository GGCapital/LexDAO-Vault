One area I've been researching lately are governance proposals and how funds affect their turnout over time. The most recent example has been the sushi kanpai treasury vote for removing rewards/fee payout from tokenholders and diverting them back to the sushi treasury to 1. pay devs, 2. diversify treasury assets

The majority of voters were against this turnout and ended up voting against the decision to go thru, however funds with large enough balances came into to push the proposal in their direction. By the end of voting the two funds had used 4-5m in voting power and the proposal passed even with the majority of users against it.

Main examples include entities like: Cumberland trading (tracked old transactions from the 0x561 address here between both the Arkham entity and this wallet). 3rd pic displays their Sushi/Dex trading wallet and how it's interacted with Sushi/Curve overtime

Goldenchain's wallet (from their initial sushi forum post on what they plan on doing for sushi and background on the Goldentree asset fund). 1st pic is their slide on my dashboard, displays Balance and past transactions along with Sushi's txs

I talked a bit about this here and found most of this info using my saved entities, main reason why i think it's a huge help for people to always label whenever they can since anyone consistently researching wallets/txs could end up losing track of random public keys.

Was a bit of a holy shit moment for me when seeing the new vote come in from 0x9C2 wallet come in, plug into Arkham and realize it's Goldenchain :CH_SmhFacePalm: Other thing I'd recommend for other users is to establish breakdowns of wallets and their respective use cases in Dashboards, ie when finding a Cumberland wallet that only interacts with Sushi<>Cumberland, adding it to a Dashboard along with Sushi's tx explorer to compare usage over time.

#### Continued Drama
HAHAHAH WTF just had a mindblowing moment realizing that the 0x9C2ba3E13616e27eC15E799797424B0c3D00cEB1 address is actually Goldenchain voting FOR the proposal lmaoaoaoaoaoa the whales have struck again

So they got funded Sept. 13th with Sushi tokens, then proceeded to vote for Jared Grey, a Legal Structure implementation, then full Treasury payouts from xSUSHI holders lol
This is the initial funding tx

So now that wallets were funded we can see they immediately decided to allocate to xSUSHI using SushiBar. Nothing wrong with that as it placed hope that the fund was here to assist the Sushi community. In reality, we can view their recent transactions and see that all attempts at community involvement have led to voting *FOR* their own personal interests.

This is an additional downside to how Cumberland is in the same league with their largest voting proposals occurring during the Head Chef saga as well. This is already a confirmed wallet of theirs and has been extremely active in overpowering votes over the past year (starting from April 2022).

##### Response to Mark
Hello Mark, I see Goldentree and Cumberland are doing whatever is necessary to push this decision forward, again swaying any remaining voter decisions in your direction. It's astonishing that there is even an attempt at explaining your reasoning when 4M+ of voting power each is used against the rest of the community.

You have mentioned clarification on the proposal itself is needed yet failed to explain why an automatic increase to 100% is needed. Yes, I agree that the community has received the bare minimum request for employee budgets, however, there has been little to no attempt to explain the following:
- where expenses have been cut in relation to team spending
- what impact do current expenses have on Sushi as a protocol
- a list of protocol features & their funding requirements for each team member
- how does the Sushi team justify such expenses with the protocol's lack of growth/improvement

> Increasing the runway will benefit all holders of Sushi, it just needs to be done with full community understanding.

For example, blanket statements such as these display no effective reasoning for why there *must* be an increase in an already extravagant runway. How does this benefit tokenholders and differentiate Sushi from other protocols if the outcome is a false veil of equal voting and pandering to 

These are only a few points to be considered, however, I think it's rather disingenuous of GoldenTree/Chain to view their investment in the protocol as a help to the community (in theory) when in practice this has become nothing more than a method for moving the balances in your favor. This is already eerily similar to voting proposals for Sushi's competitors. For a simple example, we can view the following proposals:

This tweet from Adam is a summary of what I would expect as a proper method for improving both compensation & protocol growth, yet your response relied on "runway is not sustainable for team's milestones" & "they can answer this in 12 months". In that scenario, the community would have relatively no clue as to what to expect from the team and resort to a "trust me bro" mentality, which is hardly enough to justify increased spending and removal of benefits for tokenholders.
