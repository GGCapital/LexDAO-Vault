# Profit sharing Communities (PSC)
#articles #grants 

so this covers the profit sharing communities or DAOs that arweave is trying to create

**As a PST holder you have two ways to access liquidity:**

-   Earn recurring revenue by getting paid dividends on your tokens (proportional to app usage).
-   Sell some share of your PSTs at any time on the open market. Thereâ€™s no need to wait for an acquisition or IPO.

## Community building blocks

**Founding a Community**
-   Founders mint some amount of PSTs (e.g. 1mm) and split ownership among founders (e.g. 50/50). This means each founder will earn 50% of tip revenue as PSTs accumulate value.
-   Build an application on the Arweave.
-   Initial usage and adoption begins to generate tips, or Founders can farm work out to Contributors.

So it doesn't exist yet in an archive capacity but a pool is pulled from the PSC concept where users can stake their tokens in say a "Russian politicians" archiver pool whenever that archiver is forked or a user uses tokens to access that pool a portion of those token rewards goes towards the stakers. 

Something along the lines of that. Essentially you can be long data and an archiver in perpetuity, users can either keep their token to accrue awards in pool or sell the token that is capped at X tokens and Y market cap. It'd be like a subeconomy.

Response: so this is kinda interesting, as i learned more about PSCs im mostly seeing the same characteristics when people were first describing DAOs! i think the staking tokens are good part to focus on, but regarding archiver's getting forked and users earning rewards i would really love to see different examples that could fit for permachive. 

So in this example we would be able to use community.xyz as a central place for the token to live, and provides the voting dashboards for holders https://community.xyz/#-8A6RexFkpfWwuyVO98wzSFZh0d6VJuI-buTJvlwOJQ

My main issue here is the distribution im seeing amongst holders, using ArDrive as an example it looks like there's 1106 community members but only 49 have voting power. I think optimizing to creating a more equally distributed token would be great to start out with, because from there we can really focus on building out community engagement and efficiency so that the overall protocol can have an equitable foundation

i 100% agree with being long data and an archiver as that opens up various opportunities to ppl creating strategies between different archivers. In that regard, listing a permachive token on Verto Exchange, the trading protocol for Arweave, will be the best use case for embracing the many PSCs already built on Arweave as well as allowing us to incentivize other communities to archive their data thru as!

    
Another really cool experiment would be around prediction or "truthiness" markets. So for example right now re: Ukraine and Russia most news and data sources are supporting Ukraine what if you could stake in a Russia data pool and in five years the data and news starts leaning more in Russia's favor you would get more reward tokens. You're hedging outcomes using real time as well as future data.
    
Also a real time universal permanent awareness tool would be dope. Like it picks up signals of what's going on on a map and spews out data.
