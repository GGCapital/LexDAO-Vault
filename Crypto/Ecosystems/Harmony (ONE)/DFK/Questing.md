# Questing overview

## Gardening
this has been most intriguing as now im very curious as to what else i can do with the gardeners other than send them to my jewel one and jewel avax pools
- maybe just queue all of them?
## Foraging
my four foragers are all about to level up so i should def focus on using my runes!
this can be good research for understanding how to level up and then i can get back to foraging
- pretty simple method so far, just quest -> level up -> run up a bag with better items
