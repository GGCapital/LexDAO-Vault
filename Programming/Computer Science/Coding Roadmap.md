## how do computers work?
computer is an [electronic](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/electronics.html) machine that processes information—in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.

(Apps, if you ever wondered, are just very neatly packaged computer programs.)

the computer can be reprogrammed as many times as you like. This is why programs are also called [software](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/software.html). They're "soft" in the sense that they are not fixed: they can be changed easily. By contrast, a computer's hardware—the bits and pieces from which it is made (and the peripherals, like the mouse and printer, you plug into it)—is pretty much fixed when you buy it off the shelf.

def like this explanation of the split here, so my hardware is the computer itself and the hard drive, which is used by the BIOS to connect the hardware to my operating system which is windows, where the applications live

You can think of an operating system as the "foundations" of the software in a computer that other programs (called applications) are built on top of. So a word processor and a chess game are two different applications that both rely on the operating system to carry out their basic input, output, and so on. The operating system relies on an even more fundamental piece of programming called the **BIOS (Basic Input Output System)**, which is the link between the operating system software and the hardware

## how operating systems work

Operating System (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware and provides services for programs.

There are three key elements of an operating system, which are: (1) **Abstractions** (process, thread, file, socket, memory), (2) **Mechanisms** (create, schedule, open, write, allocate), and (3) **Policies** (LRU, EDF).

this goes into thread switching, scheduling and a bunch of other shit i dont really care about, will touch back later
