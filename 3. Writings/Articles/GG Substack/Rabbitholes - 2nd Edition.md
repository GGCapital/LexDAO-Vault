this explained everything from mango to jewelboyz to mev and market sentiment
said i would talk about daos, pair trades, and my strategy for the gardens as well

instead will be doing strategy for gardens, bottoming dec 14th and ushare/tshare fork, real world use cases, and beginning of abracadabra on dfk (collateralizing jewel)

also want to focus more on sentiment and explain the dec 14-15th strategy

explaining more about harmony ecosystem and ushare play: if it aint broke dont fix it

going back over jewel charts and showing patterns that occurred that revealed similar price action time and time again

## Draft
### Summary
HELLLOOOOO!!! So its been a pretty fun (almost) month since my last lil brain dump and i think the JEWELBOYZ have benefited the most from it. You can check out the previous issue here:
https://www.getrevue.co/profile/yohangglobal/issues/gg-research-issue-1-941572

In this issue, i'd like to cover a few topics and follow back up on my last notes from the previous writeup. 

First, i'd like to explain some necessary mentality changes as i look back on 2021, followed by some easy strategies for the Gardens as well as an update on JEWELBOYZ and our recent bottom & rally on dec 14th. I've enjoyed using projects like uShare on Harmony in order to make more JEWEL, but would also like to give a first look at what collateralizing JEWEL might look like. SOL DeFi and the upcoming Saber wars have been interesting to me, so i'll dump some links on that as well. Finally, i've been spending the past two months overseas and have seen a lot of potential for some real world use cases for crypto that we could all look into!

#### a note on the past year
What i enjoyed most about this past issue was being able to put all my thoughts down into one area to refer back to and it hopefully gave a small insight to how my brain has been working over the past year (all over the place lol). I think going forward my commitment to this next lovely year in crypto will be keeping a consistent effort toward relaying these thoughts to all the lovely people following and writing out some more long-form articles. 

I won't blame crypto for this, but the past year has been such an overwhelming amount of information, resources, and opportunities (which im ever so grateful for) that it has been nearly impossible trying to keep up with anything, as well as focusing on one specific task at a time. It's this mentality of either missing out or seeing the fortune of others that ends up hurting our own progress in this space that i think everyone starting out should take more into consideration.

I remember beginning the year with my first real start in an ecosystem with the Solana community and how amazing it felt to be a part of such a journey for the protocol as well as those involved. However, even within this one ecosystem there were hundreds of projects and thousands of people to interact with, something that i truly had not been accustomed to. It became a very unbelievable form of collective efforts that came together to create something beautiful and yet, i felt as if i was such an insignificant part in the grand scheme of things, as if i wouldn't be able to assist others in the same way leaders in the community had.

What's important to me in hindsight, is to instead look at these opportunities to enter any new space as a true beginner and learning from the ground up. Hana has been an unstoppable force to observe in this space as they've basically gone from protocol to protocol, developing anything set forth in front of them. It's this mentality that i think all people entering the crypto space should take into full consideration as there's always more to learn!

https://twitter.com/cupidhack/status/1477803539036454915?s=20

To those that may also have felt the same way last year, i urge you to take the necessary time to observe your time in this space and really question whether it's been productive or more happenstance in your daily/weekly actions. Overall goals should be a keypoint for you to reach, but don't look to achieve these goals by diminishing outside responsibilities regarding your real life and mental health.

Even more important than the money at the end of the day, is what you're actually doing with it! What's amazed me the most is that there's now a seemingly infinite amount of capital and resources flowing around this space, which should be taken advantage of BUT you are in an amazingly opportune position to leverage this wealth for the greater good of humanity.

I've seen schools being built, charities being formed, even the number of CT Twitch raids where Cobie just gets people to send six-figures to random streamers, have all been amazing acts of kindness and understanding of what's happening in the outside world.

With that being said, i think this last year was a good place to start for my journey albeit it being in an up only market. Now it's time to push forward with what was learned, where failures overcame winnings and multiples were achieved at random, and truly achieve the goals that i've set forth.


### JEWELBOYZ Updates
So the illustrious JEWELBOYZ have had a great run this past month, basically 5xing returns on our Treasury since launch and achieving a new level of community that i'm really excited for. However, what i think many aren't aware of is that we have so much more to accomplish in this space! I definitely don't want this to only be a Guild as we can take a frontier-like approach at helping DFK join all of these protocols together in a beneficial manner.

#### Idea #1: Abra on DFK
one aspect of this is providing collateralization opportunities for JEWEL holders thru lending protocols like Abracadabra. i spoke on this here but will be writing a proposal to Abra and respective article using this example:
https://twitter.com/YohanGGlobal/status/1477385814439079936?s=20

here's some initial notes i wrote up on this and i got some great feedback from friends at The Brain Trust and JewelBoyz:

Right now best overall options could be Spell-jewel and mim-crystal, ie preparing for Crystalvale launch in advance and allowing for an easier onboarding of liquidity prior to Avax expansion

- Also that goes with Abra's whole vision of being multi chain and dominant on every chain 
- Works hand in hand with DFK expanding to different chains
- running sushi as an additional cross-chain dex and could use that in combo with dfk 
- This also allows for getting rid of the weak(er) Gardens on DFK 
	- say instead of one-superbid, jewel-shitcoin, use the jewel allocations for a stable farm or a liquid staking version of Xsushi-xjewel 


##### initial plan
using the many connections available between spell, sushi, and dfk to create a beneficial structure between all platforms

adding mim liquidity to sushi AND dfk would benefit both platforms instead of mass dumping $750m into sushi this allows for additional benefit toward ppl using sushi as a bridge/swap between their respective chains and onboarding onto dfk would become much easier for both communities (sushi and abra)

mim (and abra's theme) also helps in boosting the storyline behind dfk as it can become a magical, wizard-themed alternative instead of only using USDC or UST as the desired stable coin

this could also allow for the first stablecoin pool on dfk through UST-MIM which is already a highly desired decentralized stable pool

We can have lazul write this into our lore and work in parallel with the dfk team to make this a seamless entry into dfk

##### benefits for abra
this allows the opp to frontrun the avax expansion and get the frogs well-situated for the next Phase of DFK
fits perfectly with the multi/cross-chain outlook that Abracadabra has
on top of that, we would be able to create a new set of liquidity pools that adds to abra's exposure to tdifferent chains
- this creates a new storyline for dfk and introduces a gamefi aspect to abra that hasnt been seen before
- sushi would be in prime position to add additional liquidity to dfk and the recent $750m in liquidity that Abra is providing would become widely used for bridging to harmony and earning yield through DFK

##### concerns
what had to be revealed to me regarding this idea is that timing is key here. While devs are building out the game it could be detrimental to overall growth of the protocol if we immediately start launched collateralization and lending markets. Especially when considering how over-collateralized most of these apes end up being in any type of market
- why should DFK invite added risk?
- what are the true benefits of collateralizing xJewel
- should this built in-house first?

https://twitter.com/dfk_monstera/status/1477384562581901315?s=21
team has already spoken on wanting lending markets, but what is the best route for this to occur?

these were some of the questions i think we should address first and then move forward with a stronger plan ESPECIALLY in considering that DFK should gain the most benefit from any launch in this manner. 

question is wen:
https://twitter.com/blknoiz06/status/1477389239092457475?s=21
i'm mostly interested in seeing these types of opportunities pushed forward with further expansions in this same manner, but it's really up to the DFK devs on creating this reality

the OTHER SIDE of this is that we are in the crypto industry, ppl often don't care about the niceties of life and interactions. i wholeheartedly believe that if people want MIM on DFK that bad, they will bridge it over with no issue.
https://twitter.com/kratos_harmony/status/1477204978640977923?s=20

consider that once MIM is Harmony, it's a very simple add for players to create a __-MIM pool__ and then add their own liquidity as the community onboards. ideally i want to frontrun this possibility by having JEWELBOYZ at the forefront of this type of expansion and use our guild as the ideal onboarding resource for all new communities, whether DeFi or other sectors!

#### preparing for crystalvale
As of rn, im all for spreading allocations across each opportunity. I’m personally allocated in the bank more then the gardens, and bridged more jewel over to avax just in case Treasury is majority bank then gardens and we’re using the additional jewel in the multisig to send some over to avax and farm jewel-avax with. 

We want to knock off a few more summons and then look to continue compounding our gardens and send the rewards back to the bank I think best outlook rn is just frontrunnjng the eventual rush to avax. Looks like there’s 48mil or so in jewel-avax, can imagine that triples or more when the expansion happens (doesn’t take into consideration how many ppl are holding jewel in their avax wallet)

### Idea #2: Porting DFK to Solana
So this is more of a recent development that me and the rest of GG Capital really wanted to push forward, and ended up piggybacking off of Lazul's high energy and gotten the attention of Anatoly regarding the game. it's actually been funny as hell watching bro get to it, he really just has such a good nature about him and is willing to work with anyone. most likely will be a big year for him if he keeps pushing forward a lot of these connections, as it's the people that make these types of collaborations possibile!

ideally, we want to see DFK eventually expand to Solana, but it was the actual methods behind creating something like this that had escaped me at first. Anatoly here spoke on porting the game over to Rust, whereas i initially imagined that using NeonLabs and their soon-to-be (Ethereum Virual Machine) EVM-compatible release would be the best route.

![[Screenshot (120).png]]

Either way, i think we could create a beneficial opportunity for either group and in turn create a more seamless entry for Sol on DFK. I personally just want to see this happen so that i can ape into sol-jewel pools and retire lmao really wouldn't do anything else for awhile.

what really cracked me up about this is that the discussion stemmed from a tweet from Lazul about Foragers and Ragweed LOL
https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1478519678481965056?s=20

Pretty neat to see where Anatoly's interests are and/or what got him started with looking into the game. Now, speaking of Solana, let's take a quick look at some of the new situations happening in their own realm of DeFi.

### DeFi on Solana

#### The SBR Wars
okay so im a really big nerd for Star Wars and seeing anything titled the Saber Wars was just too cool to pass up on lol
https://twitter.com/n65jim/status/1477902726772277250?s=21

what's really interesting to me is the outperformance of the Saber devs themselves in releasing more of these unique and innovative protocols and then moving forward with an open view toward establishing more opportunities for holders.

i was using saber and farming for sunny right when they launched which cracks me up (and hurts deep inside) that i missed the damn near 70% run the token went on like 2 days ago. either way this seems like a much more advantageous use case of both protocols and maybe leads to veSBR tokens with Sunny going ballistic like Convex and hitting a 30x in a few months lol.

i usually dont like the aspect of just copy-pasting narratives which it seems like more people are trying to do in relating this completely to the CrvCvx saga. Saber, Sunny, and protocols like Tribeca have all the required needs to truly benefit from more cross-collaborative groupings between projects.

from what i've seen so far, and from what my good friend Teddy has told me, Sunny is basically the Cvx of SOL and that they have been buying a large amount of Sbr for ages now (pretty based if you ask me)

what seems even more evident is that TribecaDAO is at the center of all of this and yet does not have the attention of the ecosystem that it truly deserves. if they are really able to provide ve-tokenomics.

tribecaDAO:
https://twitter.com/TribecaDAO
https://twitter.com/CryptoZer0_/status/1478049492947537922?s=20

ve simply stands for voter-escrowed, meaning that users are locking up their tokens for an extended period of time and is used with a DAO (Aragon DAO in Curve's example) to decide on each account's voting power. Here's a first step for ppl to understand the model here:
https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html

All that being said it's became very evident that we have a fun lil moment occuring between protocols in Solana, especially if they can adapt on any flaws within the current Crv-Cvx narrative. I'll be diving more into this as i get accustomed to each projects relationships, i think this type of topic is due for an article.

#### SSOVs on SOL
sol defi and understanding single stake options vault
won't talk on these too much as i think the ve-tokenomics are more interesting to me but here's some helpful resources to check out for option vaults.

ideally this can become a new alternative for institutitions and funds looking for structured products on DEXes, or Decentralized Exchanges, which is where Katana is currently leading the way on Solana. past performance has been really impressive and i think we see protocols like this take the forefront as more tradfi companies onboard into crypto.

### Next time
I'll be diving into VR and some of my first insights into the metaverse! Really excited to test out the Varjo Aero as well as learn more about NeosVR (especially when considering all the recent posts by Sirkitree on Cosmos implementations). Think i'll continue with jewelboyz updates and then spend some time looking through more of the Cosmos eco and getting familiar with superfluid staking this week!

Hope you enjoyed ;)
