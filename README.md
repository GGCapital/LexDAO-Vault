**This vault acts as a 2nd brain for my research projects at [GG Capital](https://ggcapital.io), my writings on [Substack](https://ggcapital.substack.com), and random thoughts + threads on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yohangglobal).**

For the past year or so, I have been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as an ongoing compendium for my research, notes, and thoughts around the crypto industry. The majority of these notes have been private or published via our [Research Database](https://ggcapital.notion.site/Research-b47b51d18e994fadaa17467f84a0cd09) and I wanted to present how to use a tool like Obsidian for other researchers.

So far, this has made research and writing much easier for me and I think it can do the same for you. Get started on freeing up those crowded thoughts by forking this repository and adding your own content or use this Vault as a framework for your own personal research.

The ReadMe is split into installation, current content within the vault, and how this content is presented publicly. For more information on how to write your own ReadMe, visit [Protocol ReadMe](https://github.com/yohangglobal/protocol-readme).

Let's get started!

# Setup
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

To properly display this vault, download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) for your Operating System (OS) and create your own vault. From this repository, you can integrate each area you are interested in and build your database from scratch. 

Once installed, you can visit the [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git/wiki/) repository to connect your vault or simply go to "Community Plugins" within your Vault settings and search "Git".

Go to "Settings" -> "Community plugins" -> "Browse", search for "Obsidian Git", install and enable the plugin.

This repository should be the first that appears, which you can then Install and Enable within your Vault.

## Obsidian location
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

After installing the application, you can edit the folders within Obsidian through your File Explorer or within the app itself. 

Make sure you save this in a location you can remember! For me, I have this located as "Research Vault" within my GG Capital folder.

## Git Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

From here, you should make sure you have Git installed as this is how you will connect Github to your Obsidian Vault. If not, visit https://git-scm.com/download/win for your specifc OS.

When installing, you will have the option to adjust your PATH environment which allows for other sources to access Git. Click "Git from the command line and from 3rd-party software" so that your Vault can have access to this software.

## Fork and Add this Repo
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Obsidian is self-hosted within your local folders and allows for as much customization as you want. If you would like to start with this repository as your initial framework, you can fork this repository to your account or simply download the ZIP folder to your PC.

After extracting this folder, you can copy the files and paste them into your Vault folder. You can then access the files within your Obsidian download and make as many edits as you wish. 

For best practices, I would recommend becoming familiar with Obsidian's installed plugins and then expanding into the wide range of Community Plugins that have been created.

Visit [Setup](https://github.com/yohangglobal/research-vault/tree/main/0.%20Setup) for more details on how to get started and other tips.
