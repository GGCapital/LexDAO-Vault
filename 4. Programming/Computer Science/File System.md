# Organizing Files
#dev #improvements 

basically as i searched previously, the This PC thats discussed is the Yohan file that i have saved

"C:\Users\yan22\OneDrive\Desktop"

this is the Desktop file that honestly doesnt need to be there if im not mistaken but will keep watching
"C:\Users\yan22\OneDrive\Desktop"

okay now attempting to move the shit out of onedrive so that i can just have my shit on the desktop itself
this video helping out a bit too

this is the yan22 folder
"C:\Users\yan22"

okay summary i've reached is that from now i on i continue to use the gotchuglobal folder which is users/yan22 as my main place for everything

okay bet so for all my folders and shit i would go thru terminal and just have users/yan22 as automatically there

"C:\Users\yan22\Applications"

i can open terminal using the windows+x button!
"C:\Users\yan22\OneDrive\Desktop"
"C:\Users\yan22\OneDrive\Pictures"

windows+I for settings

so whats in the desktop is sending to onedrive/desktop
"C:\Users\yan22\OneDrive\Desktop\Applications"

i need all files to be sending here to the user address instead
"C:\Users\yan22\Applications"

"C:\Users\yan22\OneDrive\Desktop\Applications"

"C:\Users\yan22\OneDrive\Desktop\GG Capital\Analysts"

after uninstalling onedrive im now back to here
"C:\Users\yan22\OneDrive\Desktop\GG Capital"

just to make sure, im moving the important files over to proton drive
yeah def gonna have to close this shit out LOL
"C:\Users\yan22\OneDrive\Desktop\GG Capital"

this is gotchuglobal folder
"C:\Users\yan22"

haha okay now everything is out of onedrive. this is what's in my applications folders i nusers now
"C:\Users\yan22\Applications\7-Zip"

"C:\Users\yan22\OneDrive\Desktop\Applications"
okay this is all that's lef tsince i cant close out applications!

## Desktop folders
![[Pasted image 20220823102504.png]]
so gotchuglobal is the Users/yan22 folder and its subsequent spaces

"Yohan" is the commonly known "This PC" and includes 6 folders plus onedrive-desktop, and the main drive the C drive (currently 273GB free)

"Libraries" holds regular shit, Camera roll, music, docs, pictures, saved pics, videos etc

"Network" includes the media device (my laptop), network infra, and other devices
![[Pasted image 20220823102057.png]]

"Control Panel" opens up the control panel

"Linux" is the operating system linux and has ubuntu and the docker desktop setup - opening this leads to the ubuntu folders. honestly no idea here lmeow

"Recycle Bin" is like jam packed with folders and shit now, cracking me up how much i've deleted and reinstalled over the years

"Applications" is unfortunately the only thing left of onedrive
"C:\Users\yan22\OneDrive\Desktop\Applications"
still has this shit but whatever

from here on out, everything saves to gotchuglobal!

wiped applications and organized into proton

this is now gotchuglobal desktop code
"C:\Users\yan22\Desktop\Code"

onedrive now just has applications
"C:\Users\yan22\OneDrive\Desktop\Applications"
