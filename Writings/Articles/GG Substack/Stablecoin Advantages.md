### What is a Stablecoin?
First, let's break down the basic understanding of what a stablecoin actually is. As most cryptocurrencies are often referred to as coins or tokens, a "stable" coin in this industry refers to its value being pegged (attached) to a relatively safe asset class, such as the US Dollar. In doing so, us as users are able to exchange our current fiat money for these stablecoins, to then swap them for other tokens, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. 

Creating this type of opportunity for the average person that may be interested in crypto, provides a comfortable, yet high-yielding asset class for them to take part in. Since the majority of cryptocurrencies are looked at as wildly volatile, stablecoins have taken their mainstay as a balanced allocation for their portfolio as well as creating an alternate savings account for them to take part in without the involvement of intermediary institutions. 

Interestingly enough, stablecoins are seemingly poised to become the most accepted cryptocurrency, differentiating itself from the tokens that crypto-native individuals might rather see. This is mostly due to policy regulations and the institutions behind the largest stablecoins, such as Circle, the financial services company behind USD Coin (USDC), placing themselves at the forefront of politicians and national governments in order to gain the trust and recognition of the global economy.

However, a stablecoin (referred to as stables) such as USDC, is only the base layer of what's possible for investors and new users to take advantage of within this space. One key differentiation between the many current stablecoins we have today, are the assets backing each token. These varieties will eventually grow as more protocols are created and new founders arise with different ideas. For now, I'll cover stables backed by fiat, those supported by cryptocurrency holdings, algorithmic stablecoins, and finally, some of the more recent entrants into this space including derivative-backed stables.

Furthermore, without shilling too many of my bags, I'll go over my favorite protocols to use and some of their intuitive strategies. Hopefully this will provide a good explainer toward the various assets available for both institutions as well as everyday investors, as well as explain the surprisingly high yields anyone can earn in this space from an almost riskless token.

### Different strokes for different folks
#### Fiat-backed stables
These are the primary form of stablecoins and attempt to control the current volatility of the crypto market by associating their value with the same currency we use everyday, whether that's US Dollars, Euros, Yen, so on and so forth. From an initial perspective, this might seem like a convoluted way of thinking because why would crypto investors who do not want to take part in traditional financial systems remain attached to an inflationary asset like the Dollar? Well at the end of the day, there will always be a need for conservative allocations and overall, the ability to maintain your wealth, which is where stablecoins can provide a beneficial alternative to holding cash in a bank account.

One of the largest growing forms of this type is USDC, a stablecoin created by Circle, with the plan to onboard immense amounts of capital through their organization. As Decrypt explains here, "USDC’s parent company isn’t shy about saying the currency is for those who want to move medium to large amounts. By becoming a more attractive way for institutional investors to get involved, stablecoins like USDC could help make cryptocurrencies more mainstream." This could become a major step forward in embracing this asset class on a wider scale, barring any further detrimental regulation. As stronger connections are built between the real world and this inclusive space, the notion is that wider acceptance will lead to further development and greater opportunities for all crypto users.

Similar to a bank account, the ideal fiat-collateralized stable asset will be backed by a 1:1 ratio such as 1 USDC = 1 USD. This has the purpose of assigning real-world assets to ease anxious investors. With current governments becoming even more responsive to the call for stables within our financial system, companies like Circle and Paxos have the best opportunity at becoming fully regulated and accessible for institutions and users across the world. 

One key moment of this realization came to the forefront during a Senate Committee Hearing regarding the use of stablecoins and their inherent risks. There are many conflicting views presented by current politicians, which is understandable but should be taken into consideration when understanding the wide range of opportunities that these payment systems can provide to any new user. Senators like Pat Toomey and witnesses such as Brian Brooks are prime examples of two groups willing to portray open-minded outlooks toward the inclusion and development of a growing asset class. I highly suggest those interested in understanding this ecosystem and the backgrounds behind them to listen to the full recording here https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/stablecoins-how-do-they-work-how-are-they-used-and-what-are-their-risks.

However, as this is still a relatively new asset class, there are still potential downsides to the growth and stability of said stablecoins (ironic isn't it). These include a number of factors, primarily being the misrepresentation of collateral within these institutions possession and the overall centralization of the companies that control these assets' growth and development. It's this problematic differentiation that can cause confusion for newcomers as the assumed notion is that these assets should be accessible, but more so fully transparent to all users. 

In order to truly take advantage of this industry while still participating in the self-custodial nature of cryptocurrencies, this newfound evolution of money has taken a step further to create stables collateralized by other crptocurrencies,

#### Stables backed by ponzis
Although mostly a joke, it can be beneficial to look at all of these tokens as intuitive ponzis (similar to our current banking systems) and simply admire the creativity and efficiency behind some of these protocols. Now assume that you've just spent the past year accumulating your favorite tokens and either have a longterm outlook on their potential profit or want to leverage your current holdings in order to buy more internet money. Thanks to the foundation set by Decentralized Finance (DeFi), users are able to maintain their overall crypto portfolio and collateralize a wide range of their assets to then receive stablecoins in return.

One of the original creations of this strategy was the Maker Protocol https://makerdao.com/en/, created in 2014 with the vision to create a collateralized stablecoin (named DAI) on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain that allows the generation of DAI tokens against ETH collateral. This well-known and commonly adapted system used Vaults to lock up the collateral of any user, which they could then use to borrow DAI. As more DAI became generated and more protocols were built to leverage the growth of this protocol, a new narrative for DeFi was born as now the possibilities became endless for users.

Protocols like Compound https://app.compound.finance/ and Aave https://aave.com/ set the stage for borrowing and lending protocols going forward with a small number of allowed collateral as well as high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. For example, you could deposit 10 ETH (roughly $32.5k at the time of writing) and borrow stables for up to 75% against the current balance of ETH. A very common theme within crypto markets has been 

[Maker](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-stablecoin/), perhaps the most famous stablecoin issuer that uses this mechanism, accomplishes this through a service called “[Vault](https://blog.makerdao.com/say-goodbye-to-cdps-and-hello-to-maker-vaults/)” (formerly known as a Collateralized Debt Position), which locks up a user's cryptocurrency collateral. Then, once the smart contract knows the collateral is secured, a user can use it to borrow freshly minted [dai](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-stablecoin/), the stablecoin.


a decentralized version of stables based on an algorithm that controls each stablecoin's supply.

#### **Algorithmic Stablecoins**
Algo stables are a place where gigabrain developers thrive and create new alternatives for 

A third variety of stablecoin, known as an algorithmic stablecoin, isn’t collateralized at all; instead, coins are either burned or created to keep the coin’s value in line with the target price. Let’s say the stablecoin drops from the target price of $1 to $0.75. The algorithm will automatically burn a tranche of coins to introduce more scarcity, pushing up the price of the stablecoin. This type of stablecoin protocol is difficult to get right and has been [tried and has failed](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-stablecoin/) several times over [recent years](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-stablecoin/). Yet, entrepreneurs [keep trying](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-stablecoin/).

The final addition among stablecoin categories would take us to non-collateralized or algorithmic stablecoins. Non-collateralized or algorithmic stablecoins do not have any assets or collateral for backing them. So, how are algorithmic stablecoins classified as stablecoins when they don’t have any collateral for backing them up?

The non-collateralized or algorithmic stablecoins follow an algorithm for controlling the stablecoin supply. Such a type of approach is also known as seignorage shares. With the rise in demand, new stablecoins will be created to reduce the price to the normal level. In event of considerably low coin trading, coins on the market are purchased up for reducing circulating supply. 

Basically, algorithmic stablecoins could offer stability according to the tenets of market supply and demand. In addition, it is also important to note that algorithmic stablecoins feature the highest level of [decentralization](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-for-government/) and independence. On the other hand, such algorithmic [types of blockchain](https://101blockchains.com/types-of-blockchain/) depend on continual growth for ensuring success. You should know that there is no collateral involved with algorithmic stablecoins for liquidity, and everyone can lose their money in case of a crash.
