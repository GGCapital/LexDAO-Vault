# Blog post from FBI Femboy
Then we read the Milky Eggs blogpost to get a better understanding of what happened.

## Scan
First scan shows that this is a really good display of facts and other commentary on how this mightve happened. Especially good on following up with the stims used and other factors.  Talks about emsam and other pills, as well as the overall desire of sbf to be erratic with employees.

Drugs led to shopping sprees on ads and everything.

Explains further about alameda collusion
Breaks down to Alameda losing on Luna, then taking loans against everything else. Still theory

Summary is basically we dont know what exaclty happen but we can guess based on the market crash, Luna, bad loans, and illiquid investmetns assets like ftt/srm and the solana eco bs. 

We can try to give a very rough accounting of their potential losses:

-   Voyager/BlockFi acquisition: 1.5b
-   LUNA exposure: 1b
-   KCG-style algo crash: 1b
-   FTT/SRM collateral maintenance: 2b
-   Venture capital: 2b
-   Real estate, branding, other frivolous spending: 2b
-   FTT drop from $22 to $4: 4b
-   Discretionary longs going bad: 2b
-   **Total: 15.5**Â **billion**



## Timeline

Will continue from here but would rather read the DeFi paper for now, then phase back into FTX summaries.
