A lot of this discussion is more of a pushback on Sam's arguments that he made online vs what is being discussed behind closed doors.

Voorhees steel man argument:
SBF sees this as a stand against current arguments being made.

**SBF closing argument:**
"Nuances are in the details"
We're in a better place, at least making headway with regulators. Understands that there should be a "push and pull" outlook around potential compromises, and now we've benefited with similar industry practices compared to last year. Not sure if he's reading off a screen for this but he's basically hammering the point that people in DC have become more open to the industry and that progress should be recognized.

(Argues that people are open to changes happening, but why aren't they happening?)

Closing thoughts focuses around "we're doing better now" but doesn't clarify where we're actually heading and what he *could* change about current discussions being had with policymakers.

**Voorhees closing argument:**
Crypto has created a new financial foundation and should be recognized as such. Open/Immutable Financial Layer - it's important to understand that this involves the entire world, not just a small niche group of individuals. It pushes back against traditional financial standards and we shouldn't allow those principles to be washed away just because certain legislation are being created. 

Point blank is don't include DeFi in these bills as they come out. It's too important of a building block within crypto to screw this up.
