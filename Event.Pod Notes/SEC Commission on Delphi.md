was a very interesting listen tbh, i was kinda taken aback at how aggressive some of her comments were

this was my first time hearing from Hester Pierce and she seemed to take a fierce stance on what regulation should be set in place for crypto protocols, both permissioned and permissionless, even tho she favors permissionless
