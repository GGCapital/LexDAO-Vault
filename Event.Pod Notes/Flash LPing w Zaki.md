Compare with current gas costs and how concentrated liquidity could work

Use cases:
User wants to swap $5m YFI for ETH on SushiSwap, but there's not enough liquidity in their yfi/eth pool. Slippage is +10%, you're down bad. So, you want to add more liquidity to the pool, but just for you're transaction
