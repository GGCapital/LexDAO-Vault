**Arkham Report on Celsius** incredibly in-depth report on the Celsius collapse and where they were placed in certain DeFi pools as well as how over leveraged some of their positions were they made up the majority of a lot of platforms and fell victim to countless hacks along the way. this also covers the 0xb1 issue where an account was managing billions of customers funds in very negative yielding positions due to Impermanent Loss amazingly enough they put themselves in a ridiculous position after owing millions in uncollateralized loans and are now stil facing halted withdrawals and users faced with getting rugged by an institution that told them to UnBank themselves Give it a read thru, it's pretty good and explains a lot of the underlying schemes that were created to support the high yield they advertised to customers
