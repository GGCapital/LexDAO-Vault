## Summary
 >This report provides insights into concentrated pooled liquidity provision on Automatic Market Makers (AMMs). AMMs have revolutionized decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and have turned out to be a major use case in DeFi, to the extent that they rival liquidity on centralized exchanges (CEXes).
 >
 >After Uniswap v3â€™s introduction of concentrated liquidity in 2021, it quickly gained market share among DEXes. Compared to infinite price range liquidity provision, concentrated liquidity can be much more capital efficient. However, the flipside is an increasing risk of impermanent loss for liquidity providers.
