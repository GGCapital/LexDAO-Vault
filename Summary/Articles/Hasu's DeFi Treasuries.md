# A New Mental Model for Defi Treasuries
#articles #defi #treasurymanagement

## background  
This breaks down the background for a different outlook on treasuries and how to manage them efficiently
- ideally you dont want to have large protocols using their native tokens as part of the treasury
- case in point is Uniswap, Lido, and Compound using their respective tokens on their balance sheets
- what's viewed as billions/millions of dollars is simply the protocol gaining revenue, which is good, but isnt as beneficial as these orgs make it seem

looks cool to see these protocols benefiting from their own success, but this is actually a poor use of a treasury and ends up centralizing all of their resources -> in turn making them dependent on their own performance

### dani's deployment
- opposite example of this is Spell, Time, etc, that has instead used their expansive treasuries to invest into other protocols and basically run up a bag
	- dani tweet of deploying 100m of capital into stable farms to net them 50m a year

## traditional accounting
"Simply speaking, the **float** (all shares available for public trading) and **restricted shares** (employee shares that are currently vesting) together make up a company’s **outstanding shares**."

this brings up a good point that you can't view a company's personal shares as part of the company's overall balance sheet since that's simply going back to them at the end of the day

"authorized but not issued are not counted to the company’s balance sheet"
- here it would be very easy for these firms to simply authorize more shares going back to the company -> inflating price and therefore lying on their balance sheet
- hasu basically explains that these native tokens from each DAO are the **crypto-equivalent of authorized but unissued shares**
	- this makes perfect sense when considering these DAOs could simply mint more tokens and in turn increase supply of their assets which is meaningless at end of the day
	- how could USDT minting more tokens relate to this?

## actual defi treasuries
each use case for different DAOs and defi protocols end up displaying similarities across various statistics:
- through execution and deployment
- risk tolerance
- time horizon
- collaborative efforts amongst protocols

instead, when they broke down treasuries by their non-native tokens, in the grand scheme of things, these protocols are broke
- only lido and maker have more than 50m in treasury
- maker has the largest stablecoin positions
- uni comp etc are broke

"Third, times when Defi projects urgently need liquidity can correlate with project-specific risk: for example, when a project experiences a large insolvency event due to a bug or hack and wants to make users whole, the token price tends to be depressed as well – especially if holders expect a dilution event."

- this point becomes increasingly evident once considering how projects proceed during times of stress - whether during hacks or market crashes
- if a protocol really needs liquidity, this should then be applied toward increasing stable allocations, similar to how spell and wonderland have split their holdings between other stablecoins like UST
	- i would then take this a step further and want to see further collaborations between projects with the intention of boosting liquidity amongst various protocols
	- for example, using Abracadabra's ___ treasury and forming their own UST-MIM LP on DefiKingdoms which would then further dilute potential risks of hacks or liquidity issues -> allowing for diff use cases for Abra while helping DFK grow in liquidity

## makerdao black thursday
this example displayed how maker's failure to hold a larger treasury in stables and other assets led to nearly $10m in losses following the market crash in march 2020
- Maker could have seen up to $4 million in additional value accrual by holding a larger treasury.
- by simply holding more in stables and maybe stable farming on a faster chain -> they could have seen a much speedier recovery instead of having to grind until Dec. just to get back breakeven
- hasu explains that traditional firms hold usually 3-4% of risk capital -> this seems fucking stupid in the grand scheme of things, why not 10-15% if dealing with the volatility of crypto assets
	- maker in this example only held 500k DAI or .35% of risk capital as they had nearly $140m in outstanding loans

## what are buybacks and dividends 
the issue with the majority of these treasury holdings and their respective defi protocols almost seems to be an ego accrual instead of what should be a stablecoin accrual kek
- genuinely concerned after reading this as to why the Old Guard aka DeFi 1.0 seems to push more toward holding their own native token when considering the majority of these risks
- its been roughly two months since this article was released and we had our first major crash with the Dec. 3 dump
	- did any of these previously named protocols change their treasuries or at least manage this risk in a more efficient manner? (check back with openorgs and other wallets to see what occurred)
	- can also use zapper wallets for this as well

### longterm holders
As a DAO, we should be focused on maximizing longterm holder growth, esp when considering how quick ppl can change outlooks within the crypto space

#### rule 1
`insert pic of rule 1 here`
Hasu explains that this can follow these guidelines:
"include saving the money in the treasury, reinvesting it into growth or new products, or paying it out to token holders via token buybacks or dividends."
- would push back against token buybacks/dividends until the protocol has reached a certain level of success/growth (what is an actual threshold for growth?)
- primarily would say saving money in the treasury -> stable farming with current assets is the best use of increased profits
- even more important could be simply growing the protocol itself, whether through collaborations or building out current features
	- abracadabra expanding to different chains with their current assets in an attempt to achieve true cross-chain composability

#### rule 2
`insert pic of rule 2 here`
hate to see any protocol get ragged on like this but man Maker is full of idiots it seems like or at least was unable to consider future risks
- by focusing on selling cash to pay back out to holders and keep investors happy (fucking tradfi mindset) they should have spent that same bread building out their own protocol or simply running up a bag during the bull run
- why not spend that same amount of capital investing into other projects or farms?
- build out current protocol -> protocol receives more popularity or use case in their respective ecos -> ___ token acquires more value -> price of said token rises -> holders of ___ token are now even happier
	- within our guild this would then take place by deploying more capital within DFK through the Gardens, Hero buying and staking within the Bank **PRIOR** to trying to immediately pay back out to guild members
		- which im sorry makes literally zero fucking sense because if our intention was to immediately pay members then how the hell would we end up buying land etc

#### rule 3
`insert pic of rule 3 here`
i really think this is a key point of any protocol, not just defi projects, as being fully aware of overall value of your personal assets is key in the grand scheme of crypto
- if im Solana (whether Labs or Ventures) and i see the price of my token rise from $20 to $250 in the span of a few months, why would there be any reason to then hold the majority of these assets any longer?
	- instead, Ventures could take an "unorthodox" approach and begin selling off or borrowing against their assets -> buy back the token following a further dump
	- similar to SOL dumping from $265 to $150 in the span of a week `display chart`

"When the DAO sees the price of its token below the fair value, and it has excess cash without a high internal return, then it can buy back the token."
- even more important here is understanding fair value for any project and their respective assets, which brings into consideration a large part of crypto which is "what in the world is fair value???"
	- would this be more so determined by price appreciation, future EV or current use cases for said token?

## path to better treasuries
in an up only market, word to Path, there's a specifici period of time that founders, devs, traders all have the ability to 10-100x their wealth
as a treasury manager, this is a key moment to allocate more toward risk-on assets and exploring further innovations outside of your focus
for us this took place with focusing on solana's rise, but then realizing the importance of multichain defi with the emergence of Spell in late July
the next step for this was expanding into gaming thru Jewel

### rule 4
hasu explains that as a dao, those native tokens shouldn't be considered as part of your balance sheet, and instead be used to leverage exposure across any/all crypto ecos

### rule 5 
dao treasuries need to survive any incoming bear market! Here's how this can occur and what founders can do to truly maximize their current wealth as well as achieve a consistent payout for their community and team members

**Rule 5:** DAO treasuries need to survive the next bear market. It might not happen next week or next month, maybe not even next year. But in a market as driven by speculation as crypto it will happen. Build a treasury that will last you 2-4 years even if the entire market collapses by 90% and stays there for some time. 

We recommend 2-4 years specifically because you want enough to survive even the longest crypto winter by known standards, but not so much that you get rich and lazy, or too distracted by running your protocol like a hedge fund. 

Considering the known operating expenses of major DAOs with large dev teams and liquidity mining programs, very few if none satisfy that condition today. That means, most or all of them should use the bull market to sell tokens and build real treasuries with stable assets that will not only make them survive the coming bear market but hopefully put them ahead of their competitors.

**Rule 6:** DAO treasuries should understand their application-specific liabilities and hedge them. For example, a lending market might plan that some % of loan positions will fail every year. While they don’t say so explicitly, it is implicitly understood that the lending market underwrites that risk. So the underwriting becomes a regular cost on their balance sheet and can be hedged accordingly. Meanwhile, a leaner protocol like Uniswap may underwrite no additional risk and hence could do fine with a much smaller treasury.
