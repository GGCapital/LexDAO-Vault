## Helpful tips

After creating a ReadMe file within your repository, make sure to Pull changes within Obsidian prior to making any Commits/Pushes as the disconnection will affect any automatic Pushes you've enabled.

Following initialization, try and create a framework around adding files and new resources as you learn. For instance, I have a Discord server that I dump information into but it can be a lot of data after a few days. What I plan on doing is setting up time throughout/at the end of the day to scrape through my past messages and add them to different parts of the Vault. Since I have a private vault for everything and this public vault, my next goal is finding a way to sync certain sections together or being able to cross-check each vault for any missing files between the two.

Once you fork this vault, you should be able to copy the interior files into your own vault, similar to copy-pasting folders/files. From there, you can open up Obsidian and stylize your vault using Community Plugins. Here's the main ones that I use:
- Calendar - keeping up with my schedule and what I wrote each day
- Dataview
- Day Planner - planning out each day
- Excalibrain & Draw
- Kanban
- Mind Map - for fun
- Ozan's Image - great for copying images
- Style Settings - using this a lot
