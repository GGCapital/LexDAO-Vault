# How to connect Obsidian to Github

## Setup
Visit https://obsidian.md/ and download for your OS

Once installed, you can visit the [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git/wiki/) repository to connect your vault or simply go to "Community Plugins" within your Vault settings and search "Git".

Go to "Settings" -> "Community plugins" -> "Browse", search for "Obsidian Git", install and enable.

This repository should be the first that appears, which you can then Install and Enable within your Vault.

### Git Installation
From here, you should make sure you have Git installed. If not, visit https://git-scm.com/download/win for your specifc OS.

When installing, you will then need to adjust your PATH environment. Click "Git from the command line and from 3rd-party software" so that your Vault can have access.

## Helpful tips

After creating a ReadMe file within your repository, make sure to Pull changes within Obsidian prior to making any Commits/Pushes as the disconnection will affect any automatic Pushes you've enabled.

Following initialization, try and create a framework around adding files and new resources as you learn. For instance, I have a Discord server that I dump information into but it can be a lot of data after a few days. 

What I plan on doing is setting up time throughout/at the end of the day to scrape through my past messages and add them to different parts of the Vault. Since I have a private vault for everything else and this public vault, my next goal is finding a way to sync certain sections together or being able to cross-check each vault for any missing files between the two.

Once you fork this vault, you should be able to copy the interior files into your own vault, similar to copy-pasting folders/files. From there, you can open up Obsidian and stylize your vault using Community Plugins. Here's the main ones that I use:
- Calendar - keeping up with my schedule and what I wrote each day
- Dataview
- Day Planner - planning out each day
- Excalibrain & Draw
- Kanban
- Mind Map - for fun
- Ozan's Image - great for copying images
- Style Settings - using this a lot
