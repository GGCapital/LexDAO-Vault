# How to Stay Consistent in Coding

Edit: I just want to add a bit of context to my original answer. For everyday self-study, one of the keys to motivation is variety. The following is a rough categorization of different things you can do in addition to textbook reading. They all **feel different**enough that you can choose on a day-to-day basis what you feel motivated to accomplish. They are all designed to **integrate what you learned** in ways that concretely make you a better programmer/computer scientist.

First:

**Self-review questions** : Quickly check your understanding by asking yourself to define the concepts in your own words. A prelude to this is taking adequate notes of stuff you might forget.

**Source exploration** : Read the source of libraries that implement the concept. Try to follow the logic as much as possible (i.e. don't just glance, sometimes the devil is in the details). This also includes reading the necessary documentation.

**Code snippets** : Try to apply the concepts in condensed code snippets to check that you are comfortable with coding them. The goal here is to get familiar enough with the implementation so its easier to remember later on.

**Projects** : Try to build a project that relies on the concept(s), but in a bigger context where it also interacts with other moving parts. Document and comment as much as possible, and archive it on Github or whatever when you're done.

**Articles** : Further your understanding by reading technical articles on the concept. You'll get a better understanding of the cutting-edge, and it will also expose you to newer ideas.

Adding to this: chapter and article summaries. This practice has really helped me solidify knowledge: if you can't describe it you don't understand it.

Second:

**Sometimes authors make things sound more complicated than the actual code.**

You're having a hard time reading a chapter each day because you're putting too much emphasis on the author's words. **The author's words are a guide, not an instruction. On the flip side, the code is an instruction, not a guide.** The the code speaks for itself. Be hard on yourself if you don't understand the code, but don't blame yourself if you cannot understand what the author is saying.

As you write more code, soon you'll start understand what the author actually means when he says this, or that.

The above 3 are the main advice, however if you want more introspective advice, read onward.

**When you learn from a book, you want to read it for internalization, not memorization.**Memorization is required for internalizing information, however you never want to memorize everything.

**The way you internalize a concept is personal to you. I know its cliché**, however when it comes to the mind, it is always a matter of doing whatever YOU feel will allow you to perform optimally. Ask your self, "when do I feel most confident about what I've read?". When you ask yourself this question, keep in mind the following:

(Note that this information was gained from my own analysis of my experience)

**You cannot maintain the mental energy to learn everything, so learn what is important for you in the moment.** For example, If you're reading a chapter, and thinking to yourself "wtf am I reading? I dont get this shiz" just skip it, move on to another chapter, soon you will find a reason to come back to this chapter and finally read it.

Most concepts become incredibly obvious when you copy it, paste it, compile it, run it, and then come back and read the syntax, and then you will have better chance understand how the syntax is creating that sort of reaction from the computer.

**Memorize syntax only for the purpose of understanding the rest of the chapter.** After you've finished reading the chapter its okay to forget the syntax, however never forget the concept you learned. In my personal experience I almost never forget concepts when I read about something, so I think this will be easy for you too. You don't need to remember the concept with exact clarity, a rough explanation is good enough.

Only remember things related to the following 3 phrases:

**"That's cool, I never knew about this concept. Now I know"** - try to encapsulate what the author is saying into a concept that is intuitive to you. Note that your understanding may not be accurate when you're only reading, however when you actually implement an example of the abstract concept, you will gain more clarity. In my personal experience, I always understand a concept so much clearly when I have a clear instance example of the abstract concept. I look back between the instance and the abstract explanation and interpolate from instance to abstract.

**"So that's what its like to implement this concept"** - Look at the code in terms of pages first, and see how those pages interact with each other. Then in terms of functions and see how those functions interact with each other. Then in terms of lines. And then in terms of individual syntax. If my way doesn't work, then it is your job to find out how YOU will obtain this feeling in your own way. This is mainly a trick that I use sometimes, however I don't stick to it all the time.

**"So that's when I should use this concept"** - This probably the second most important feeling. Knowing a concept is one thing, however knowing when its useful to use it is even better. This feeling is explained in the book, and it also becomes more obvious as you spend more hours writing code.

If you forget everything I said, remember this: **Code is only judicator that matters**.
