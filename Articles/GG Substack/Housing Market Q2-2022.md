### Email draft
After you mentioned selling the house I wanted to take a look at the overall housing market and gauge where the broader macro environment has placed home prices. General interest as of now has been in monitoring Mortgage rates (specifically 30-yr mortgage rates), Multifamily rentals, overall Demand for housing, Applications for housing, Price cuts in housing, and the Fed's holdings of [Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS)](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/types-investments/bonds/types-of-bonds/mortgage-backed-securities#:~:text=Mortgage%2Dbacked%20securities%2C%20called%20MBS,million%20worth%20of%20such%20mortgages. "Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS)").

Primary thoughts from mutual friends are that the housing market has become so heavily concentrated the past couple years that by combining the rising inflation we're faced with, people are now unable to pay back loans and debts. This means that mortgages could explode in a worse manner than 2008.

The cause to this effect has been the Fed's monetary policy changes toward [Quantitative Easing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing.asp "Quantitative Easing"). This is where the Fed purchases long-term securities to increase the money supply, the ideal goal being to encourage lending and investments by lowering interest rates. They essentially printed $700 billion to buy Treasuries and MBS each month. In doing so, they planned on stimulating economic growth

The flip side of this is Quantitative Tightening or QT, where the Fed will sell their holdings of US Treasury and MBS for USD with the hopes of tightening domestic credit conditions. The purpose here being that this process will expand the US money supply and the Fed balance sheet, while having low impact on domestic conditions.

Ever since the 2020 crash, interest rates have been as low as they could possibly be (Attachment 1). When they rise rates this leads to rising inflation, which then affects variable interest rates on credit cards and other debt. The undoing of this becomes consumer's inability to pay loans and credit debts over an increased period of time. Even so, the benefactor is supposed to be that with central banks being used as intermediaries instead of placing cash in consumers hands, that their would be less risk for inflation to occur. Unfortunately, it took a larger portion of the market to see this coming and has led to consecutive selloffs in the broader global markets.

One helpful series to read through interest rates and their impact on consumers and businesses is [Investopedia's guide](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/010616/impact-fed-interest-rate-hike.asp "Investopedia's guide") through the Federal Reserve, Monetary Policy, & Interest Rates. It's much more in-depth than this email will be and should provide a large amount of background knowledge for the current market we're in.

## Multifamily rentals

## Mortgages
The biggest factor here is the Fed buying mortgage backed securities as part of their monetary policy to drive the money supply

as of just recently Fed Chair Jerome Powell explained they'll look to sell MBS securities when their balance sheet reduction is underway. Ideally we need to be much earlier if looking to sell, otherwise home prices would be expected to plummet

![[Pasted image 20220622185123.png]]

30-year mortgage rates being quoted north of 6%. A $1 million home at a 3% mortgage should be $680K at 6.25%. That’s a price decline of -32%. This myth of tight supplies keeping the housing market propped up is embarrassing.

### Demand
Mortgage demand is crashing, and with it housing prices will fall quite a bit. MBS went no bid on Friday, before the Fed has even started to sell their holdings. Meanwhile, home buyer sentiment is at historic lows as the combination of high rates and prices keep buyers at bay.
![[Pasted image 20220618130933.png]]

MBS goes “no bid” meaning demand has really dried up, so MBS yields and mortgage rates probably need to rise substantially.

### Applications
Don't expect the housing market to be spared. Prices just take somewhat longer to adjust. Mortgage applications are already falling sharply as mortgage rates are surging at a record pace.
![[Pasted image 20220618125624.png]]

Housebuilder sentiment is next in line, with a 6-month lag to mortgage rates.

![[Pasted image 20220618125636.png]]

Eventually prices adjust, typically with a 12-month delay.

### 30yr mortgage rates
rates are now reaching previos levels from the 2008 recession, with 30 yr rates at 5.78%, up nearly 3% in the past year

![[Pasted image 20220622190214.png]]

In Jan 2021, the 30-yr mortgage rate was 2.65% and average new home price in the US was $401,700. Today the 30-yr mortgage rate is 5.78% and average new home price is $570,300. Assuming a 20% down payment, that's a 106% increase in the monthly payment (from $1,294 to $2,671).

Global recession is coming. Yesterday's inflation surprise in the US pushed up the real 30-year fixed rate mortgage another 25 bps (black). Monetary policy in the US works via housing and it's the housing market that will go into deep recession to get US inflation under control.

key factor here being that housing market will have to collapse to bring overall market back to parity

### Pentosh quotes

Explain the math to me. Housing keeps going up forever. (apparently) Is recession proof (where we are heading) lose your job? It's proof that too! Electricity goes up 2x? Also proof that. Rates go up. proof that. Inflation up? proof that. Bonsues cut? proof that too!

## Home Price/Earnings
Is this Housing Bubble BIGGER than 2008? Yes. 2008: Prices 8.0x higher than Avg Worker Earnings 2022: 8.5x higher Price/Earnings tells you how OVER/UNDER valued your Housing Market is. This example used Phoenix. Buckle up. Buying opportunities are coming.
