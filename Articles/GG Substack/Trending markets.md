# How to adapt to trends
#strategies #threads 

This can be a great thread to write up as well to give people examples on what not to do during trending markets and how ppl should be reacting to price action

One of example can be trading Solana and how bullish retests end up resulting in full retraces or any down mogement

This is when you can't look at trades as something to get in and out of, instead you should be looking to add on dips, trim on rips if you're trading perps, and prioritizing spot holdings if overall market is bullish

SoLunAvax literally the best example of this as each had their own narratives. I will briefly explain their situations and where an amateur trader (like myself) made mistakes and how you can learn from them. 



## draft
When a market is trending, several things should be assumed. Take a clear uptrend. Some principles may be as follows. Breakouts are likely to stick. Pullbacks are likely to be shallow. Support is likely to work, while resistance is less likely to work. Holding on to long entries until they reach (much) higher levels of resistance is reasonable. You get the gist.

Many of these assumptions can be reversed for a ranging market. Breakouts/breakdowns are less likely to stick. Pullbacks are likely to be deeper. Support and resistance are equally likely to work. Holding entries past take profit levels is unreasonable. And so on. One way to lose money (or leave a lot of it on the table) is by misidentifying the market regime you’re in. If you’re trading rangebound setups in a trending market, you will almost always close trades too early, rarely get your picky entries, and likely get burned stepping in front of impulsive moves.

## index/mark price
Index Price and Mark Price
When first starting futures trading you should be well-aware of the terms and metrics that you'll be interacting with.

For perps, there will always be an Index Price that you'll be trading with. THis represents the fair price of the asset when comparing to certain parameters. However, the settling of the futures contracts themselves will occur at the Spot price.

The Mark Price is overall going to be the mid/avg price of the perp you're trading. A basic goal for the Mark Price is committing to not diverging too far away from Spot price. This is very important for understanding liquidations as well as your ongoing PnL.
