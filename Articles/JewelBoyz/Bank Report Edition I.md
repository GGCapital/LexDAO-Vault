Alas, lads! It’s time for the first installment of the monthly Bank Report! 

As the Bank Teller of Falador, this report will provide a general overview of the monthly actions and financial decisions by our JEWELBOYZ Guildmasters and our members. I will be explaining hero purchases, $JEWEL staking, compounding LPs in our illustrious Gardens, and anything else related to the guild's finances.

First things first, our Guildmasters strive to be transparent in how we manage the treasury and other transactions. Listed below are all the JEWELBOYZ related wallets and their purpose:

-   **JEWELBOYZ Multi Sig:** 0x082e32f4096C75d3423764157ab539077b69BD39
    -   _Strong accountability measure to ensure a single member can’t make financial decisions without the majority in agreement; the threshold is currently at 3/6 members required for a transaction to be enacted_
-   **JEWELBOYZ Middle Man:** 0x9B9d4F779C25c053F37733237A58F34aAa309b08
    -   _Wallet is mainly used for initial payments/guild fees and the main way we route entries in the ledger; majority of tranactions are directed to "Multi Sig" wallet_
-   **JEWELBOYZ Official Treasury:** 0x1d2Caf8c57c2A7AEfb335917d2955Af63fDfBc56
    -   _The central point for the Guild's Treasury and where we delegate full allocations to sectors of DFK; a mainstay wallet with primary holdings within the Bank_
-   **JEWELBOYZ Hero Treasury:** 0xC002FFEC566ac9194813BC33a43ca22db10fB15E
    -   _The wallet where the guild's heroes are stored, Guildmasters originally had to use their personal wallets for this but now all current heroes and guild contributions will be kept here_

**Treasury Performance**

Over the process of three weeks we've nearly received a 400% return for our Treasury through the combined efforts of: JEWEL price increasing to $11, new guild members and their contributions, compounding our Gardens, executing on inefficiencies in the Marketplace, and top-tier hero purchases from our Guildmasters. As the Bank Teller's part in the game has been more observant, it's became clear that compounding yield and flipping items/heroes in the market have provided the best payoff.

As market conditions tend to change, we wanted to make sure we added to our pools when the time was right. This began with delegating out from the JBz multisig to send our Jewel to the Bank to stake, with a split allocation added to both pools once Avax and One had begun to bottom out.

**Gardens**

The guild currently holds positions in the JEWEL-ONE and JEWEL-AVAX LP pools. Our initial foundation followed the same allocations as before with 20% of guild fees dedicated to the Bank and 25% allocated to the Gardens.

A JEWEL-stablecoin LP has interest in it, primarily JEWEL-UST, which we will decide on when to add in funds. The guild isn't too worried about Impermanent loss as the high APR of the pools cover any negative yield. However, this also limits the upside to only half of the LP. 

**Bank**

xJEWEL has remained in the Bank as part of our longterm outlook on DefiKingdoms and will be used primarily as a place to earn yield and gain exposure to further benefits of the Kingdom. This includes pursuing upcoming land auctions, being eligible for snapshots, and preparing for future expansions. We also inted to use Bank funds to add into our Gardens when needed. ONE and AVAX are safe choices since they are native coins necessary for utility on Harmony and Avalanche respectively, which has maintained our interest as part of the Crystalvale launch.

**Summary**

This piece was originally supposed to be released when JEWEL was at $6.53, which is where we allocated the Multisig holdings over to the Bank. Now, with JEWEL worth $12  our General Treasury wallet has a 2:1 split share between the JEWEL-AVAX & JEWEL-ONE LP, both earning 669% APR and 484% APR, respectively. Balances have tripled in value, with the Hero Treasury wallet being the most profitable at the time of writing.

Regarding the Hero wallet, we try to hold at least 100-200 JEWEL to be used for summoning/buying and flipping heroes. The guild currently has exposure to . Banked JEWEL is currently at 906.75 JEWEL (558 xJEWEL at _1 xJEWEL = 1.625 JEWEL_) and also where the bulk of the guild’s funds are focused. During this recent rally we've been removing the JEWEL held in the JEWELBOYZ Middle Man and Multi Sig wallets and sending to the Bank. The guild's goal from her out is to get to as many multiples of 1k xJEWEL as we grow!
