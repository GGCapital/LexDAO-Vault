**Liquidity in Distressed Markets: A Conversation with Sam Bankman-Fried**  
_**Sam Bankman-Fried**_, Founder & Chief Executive Officer, FTX*
Followed By a Post Interview Sidebar  
_What Happens to Crypto in Bankruptcy?_ **Suzzanne Uhland**, Partner, Latham & Watkins

Is sam confident of being lender of last resort, is there more to go, are they scaling back?

"sure theres something we havent seen yet. not big things that will cause issues. if we see crash, would be tough. we made most of the moves that we could've interpreted by now"

Any big lessons that DC can learn?

"Look at some cases with more transparency, legal violations with the practice itself. For instance how large was 3ac in the broader market, understanding what the risk was. Didn't happen bc of no reason, wasn't regulators saying eh doesn't matter. Platforms were already investigated but unfortunately timing was just dogshit. 

There's a price of inaction, very common in all things of life. Everyone is to blame for something like this."

Did this hurt any momentum in overall crypto market? Will regulators be more cautious?

"This most likely just brings it to the forefront, not necessarily hurts momentum. There should be more oversight but what will occur from here on (SEC and CFTC going crazy this year, think we can assume that it's been working)."

Is contagion a larger risk now?

"There should be more integrations with regulatory oversight, blockchains have more to offer."

Whatchu gon do with Voyager bro?

"We're comfortable with where that ended, getting ready to return assets to users on the platform. Happy to play that role."

You looking at anything else?

Says i havent looked at Celsius recently, not sure if they'll do something there or not. 

As lender of last resort, should there be more of these? Should private companies be standing in?

"FTX has no problem being the central source but it should be more distributed. People in the industry can get together and backstop crises as they occur. Creating a system like this would make a lot of sense"

Why aren't there more public companies stepping in?

"Well I mean it's a messy deal. You want something good, but the company is bankrupt...what do you think is going to happen."

What about regulatory arbitrage? Is there gaps between all the diff global regulators?

"They're paying attention to this a lot more. No global framework, one country's choices don't relate to another's. Lot of this ends up being messy, different levels of protection during this in between period of various levels of compliance. He wants to see set of frameworks that will allow for oversight in other jurisdictions."
