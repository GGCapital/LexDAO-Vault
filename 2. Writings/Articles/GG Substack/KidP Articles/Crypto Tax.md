**Overview**

1.  IRS Consideration
    1.  The IRS considers cryptocurrency holdings to be “property” for tax purposes, which means your virtual currency is taxed in the same way as any other assets you own, like stocks or gold. If your only crypto-related activity this year was purchasing a virtual currency with U.S. dollars, you don’t have to report that to the IRS, based on guidance listed on your [Form 1040 tax return](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf).
2.  Trading Cryptocurrency
    1.  It becomes taxable when you use your crptocurrency as a method of exchange. Incluidng selling crpto for U.S. dollars, exchanging one cryptocurrency for another - buying Etherium with bitcoin - or paying for goods and services with cyrpto.
    2.  “Whenever you sell the investment, or exchange the investment for another investment, that is when a taxable transaction happens,” says [Daniel Johnson](https://www.refocusfp.com/about-us), a financial advisor and founder of RE|Focus Financial Planning in Asheville, North Carolina. “You’ve got to be careful if you’re doing a lot of trading. If you’re going in and out of different [types of cryptocurrency](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/types-of-cryptocurrency/), every single time you place that trade, it is a taxable event.’
3.  When you will owe taxes on Cryptocurrency Example
    1.  “The difference between the amount you spent when you bought or received the crypto (its cost basis) and the amount you earn for its sale is the capital gain or capital loss — what you’ll report on your tax return. Broadly speaking, if you bought $100 worth of Bitcoin and sold it for $500, you’d see a capital gain of $400. If your Bitcoin lost value in that time, you’d instead face a capital loss. If your losses exceed your gains, you can deduct up to $3,000 from your taxable income (for individual filers).”
    2.  “The amount of time you owned the crypto plays a part, too. If you held onto a unit of Bitcoin for more than a year, it would generally qualify as a long-term capital gain. But if you bought and sold it within a year, it’s a short-term gain. These differences can affect which tax rate is applied. The tax rate also varies based on your overall taxable income, and there are limits to how much you may deduct in capital losses if your crypto asset loses value.”
4.  Reporting Crypto Income
    1.  The IRS viewpoint: A taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services must, include the fair market value of the virtual currency, measured in U.S Dollars, as of the date that the virtual currency was received
        1.  To track the fair market value is the responsibility of the user
    2.  Frequently Asked Questions on Virtual Currency Transactions

5.  Looking Forward
    1.  “A section of the $1.2 trillion [bipartisan infrastructure bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684), signed into law by President Biden last November, requires brokers — aka [cryptocurrency exchanges](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-cryptocurrency-exchanges/) — to issue a 1099-B. In other words, crypto exchanges will be required to notify the IRS directly of [crypto transactions](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions).”
    2.  There are crypto-focused tax software programs you can use to simplify the process. Input data on all crypto trades or earnings across all exchanges you’ve used, the software will generate the cost basis for your trades and help determine capital gains and losses
        1.  “Some of these programs — [CoinTracker](https://www.cointracker.io/), [TokenTax](https://tokentax.co/), [CryptoTrader.Tax](https://cryptotrader.tax/), and more — are compatible with regular tax programs like TurboTax or TaxAct, so you can easily import the gains and losses they report to your tax return.”
