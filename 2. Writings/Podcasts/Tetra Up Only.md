## what is the future of convex?
will expand further than curve
- brilliant tokenomics system
	- printed based on amount locked
	- give crv -> get cvx
	- increasing supply of cvx based on crv share
- now also getting fxs
- largest holding secondary to eth
	- simple setup -> def big going forward
	- buy convex earn profits -> vote escrow

can arb the difference on cvxcrv and crv to earn on fees and differences
- not worried about pegging or having the depeg be fucked
- apr on cvx is hidden -> only 4% -> but is actually delegated to bribes, votium etc

### wtf is votium?
at the heart of it all -> liquidity providers and earning crv -> bid to earn a dollar
- over time this is decided by the free market
- the right to earn more crv in the future
	- 50% for crv stakers
	- cvx token is built on top of crv -> permanently stakes crv
	- always takes tax on crv -> yields more bread over time
- entices ppl to use it -> everything is a ponzi -> lets make money off it

Ponzi the operator can rug you -> same with agencies
- code does exactly what it says it does
- lives on chain -> will continue operating

## L1 vs L2
creating a multichain future, not cross chain
- solana has too many issues and founder is basically gaslighting any issues that occur
- interesting opportunity for better plays to occur

cosmos is the better route here
- to build another dapp on atom -> will be big for future additions
- blockchain of blockchain architecture
- def going with cosmos for future growth

## Tetra's alpha
erc 4626 - by owen fernau
- no idea what this is
- this standard is for yielding assets and using for collateral
	- put in cvx -> get stablecoins -> and cant claim the yields
	- now this proposal makes this collateral still possess its current yield bearing tokens
	- this will be big for cvx stakers as now they can use their assets for collateral

plugin for convex liquidity
- deposit into rari fuse pools
- then can claim yield from staking AND use as collateral with usdc

### Turbo
take the market for minting stables
- deposit an asset that's whitelisted
- mint stables from it -> right into yielding protocols
	- use this to print fei

progression in defi 2.0
- get paid money for borrowing money
- this is basically the infinite approach to the flywheel, esp when considering how much will be built thru a product like this

however where is this multichain future going to occur?

Blockworks: FeiRari -> merge with rari and fei
- the hack that occurred -> embrace it and help them from going
- survived and invested into the neuroplasticity of the team
- has to catch up with whats happening
	- eager to hang on and see what's happening

### Fei
has the largest treasury
- innovative structure and owns the tribe necessary
- rari hack victims -> will be important going forward on how to 

last speech:
buy rari at $15 that is a worthless gov token
- rgt is now even more
- 1/26 conversion -> 1rgt gets 26 tribe
- quarter of the way there
- tribe is the other token of the gauntlet

now gonna market buy tribe
- cobie bought the previous round of tribe
- then bought at the rari merge
- fuse pool with 100% apy -> tribe was 50%
	- two-three months ago -> bought then

joey is a very capable man and executes like the rari team
- solved each other problems

### Dopex
dope for uying into a a ponzi
- decentralized options exchange
- silly sounding names work best

(quick squeeth)
minus whatever funding occurs
still shorts vs longs that's redistributed
- very new product
- if interesting proudct -> dopex will add to vaults
- will be interestin got combine the two

non-custodial derebit
- market making advisor with defigod
- architecture and new tokenomics will be added soon
- options pricing for eth calls with new defi option

dopex can be used as collateral and works as a governance token
- really big going forward as it'll be implemented with a CRV style tokenomics
- rdpx is the better play maybe?
- earns from premiums

rebate DPX
- earns from all fees
- infinite inflations
	- burning makes it deflationary  allocation
	- earns from snx and other protocols

dpxusd
bonding lp tokens like rdpx-eth
stablecoin for dpx
- has a bunch of cvx tokens so will be using for dpxusd

single staking options vaults
- priortizing this cus it helps onboard new ppl
- gauges supply and demand going forward
- only exercisable -> can put together execution thru secondary markets
	- on-chain options are difficult but now can make them permissionless

tldr
bascially making it easier for daos to make vaults for their own product
- daos like olympus can put excess tokens
	- make delta neutral strategy for the treasury

50+ daos tryna deploy on dopex for vaults
- can onboard small caps -> be the uniswap of options
- anyone can join
	- jewel launch will be huge

this cranks up holders for dpx and rdpx holders
- willl be biggggggg for further growth for dpx
	- use rdpx to print dpxusd AND synthetic shares
	- use chainlink oracles for this

this mostly stays as a delta neutral strategy
- can also use rewards from dpx for this
- more so in the positive direction

atlantic options
- euro and american options
- collateral the options themselves for more yield
- efficiency doesnt matter

composability and liquidity with high yield will attract the best price
- stable swap is the best with curve

everlasting options -> waiting to see what happens with the market
- full implementation -> might impact composability
- ssov architecture can then run any dao and tokenomics
	- incorporate 4626 into options calls

Earning staked cvx yield that earns you money from the calls
- dpx rewards on top of this
- highest conviction bet
	- follows tetra's advice calls exactly

ledger tries a ftx fortune cookie
- zero stars, use more preservatives
- slightly related to crypto fortunes

### jpeg'd
nft lending protocol
- part of seed founders
- no bottom line -> making defi public good
- if you get liquidated on jpeg'd protocol
- can buy back nft -> clown sponsor "good luck kid you''ll need it"


- very illiquid assets like cryptopunk
	- how cna you take a loan out here?
	- deploy chainlink oracle to establish a floor price
	- free of flash loans

jpeg is worthless gov token that will ICO
- increase limit for protocol with your punks
- attach a value with your nft

Punk is worth half a mil
- can get 100k from this after locking your acct
- can earn fuse off of it too

@jpegd_69

hidden factors and variable before they launch
- 5 day ICO to be announce
- punks are first
- rocks and bayc soon to follow
	- buying the rock gives you access

nft market is now the driving force between defi
- bringing profits to nfts
	- holders -> speculators
	- can buy back assets with discounts/fees

gentle liquidation -> pay fees and use the platform as intended

### Vesta finance
backed by maki
- sushiswap and took to where it is today

can collateralize eth and renbtc
- fork of liquidity
- use to earn collateral in stablecoins

## tokenomics issue
makerdao and dai are great products
- really questionable
- buybacks are bad and distributin gmore to insiders is shitty
	- better to add to treasuries
	- have mkr staked and earn  a part of that fee

if tetra is an investor
- buybacks only help early investors
- needs to find ways to back the protocols
- repeats same principles over and over

freeriding pool 2
- really important doesnt help anything

buyback and burn
- new retail trap
- this is common in bsc projects
- only good thing is it doesnt give a monetary premium

would you buyback your shit and burn it
- not the best model to pursue

### sismo dao?
uses zero knowledge proof
- attestation?
	- own 10 punks across 10 diff accts
	- has these many punks and that you're a gigachad
	- participants in a mill. club
		- can have a badge where it verifies this 
		- doesnt give identity etc
- sismo helps incentivizes users
	- takes market share without tokenomics

says he staked look token for money

### rocket pool
1/20th of lido
- any operator can join the network and run it
- 75k eth staked
- rocket pool tokens used as insurance

token scales with node operators
- 110% insurance here

two validators for the price of one
- node operator over solo staker
- idk much about this but yeah $RPL

### abracadabra
setting this up for future outlook
- very high loan to value
- can fold and magnify yields
	- fold it 9 times to delta neutral profits

huge warchest
- abra and dani are superpower combo
- now making otc lending markets

loan nfts that represent house
- bid what they would charge as 
- mim to earn mim and then settle the value with open liquidity everywhere

### frax finance
- can research frax finance on docs
- L2 and multichain future
- FPI for frax stakers
	- doesn't cover too much
- compressing alpha but just ape anyways

it's a sell the news event, so which one
- reply guys will reply guy so just buy this shit anyways

### ohm
backed by 700m in capital
- owns 7% of klima, 20% of redacted
- buying more convex for curve wars

permissionless olympus pro
- create a bond at a discount -> 3% fees

what is a curve war?
- daos fighting over the right to earn yields and liquidity from curve
- mostly a whale war

### redacted cartel
unstable ohm fork
- intakes degen treasuries that copy tradse
- ohm earns 20% of redacted supply thru bonding
- acquired tokemak

working with top protocols
- for all voting escrow protocols
- took profit on btrfly token here
	- you are redated

### chainlink
all assets require a chainlink oracle
- expanding features everywhere

hired teh founder of google
- founders continuously sell chainlink
- price go up when founders dont sell
- former ceo of google

## tetra's outlook
buy more ether -> dont sell and buy ether
- there is no second best
- legendary speech lmao

waiting for the merge before the frozen market continues
all of ended up happening
no extended bear market
- 2013 experience -> means more than justthe ppl just getting in on 2017
	- 2013 existential cycle -> boom bust cycle still happens

crypto has been nonstop in the news
- majority have heard of the coins
- does the social cycle happen alongside the new bull cycle
	- will the run happen again
	- mass speculation -> not mass adoption

do we need something that integrates with real financial system
- can we make a new system instead?
- is it up to the builders themselves
	- good will ferrell skit

How can we catch up with defi
- learn about cryptography -> cryptography 101
- then about tokenomics -> learn about avax and other aspects
	-  to find out about this
	- learned from technical foundation

## Life alpha
if you love what you do -> dont have to work another day in your life
- constant state of being tired but still loves what he does
- find family life -> and balance out everything
	- totally worth it to have this experience
