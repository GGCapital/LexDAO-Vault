My main question for 2022 and the years forward that I tweeted the other day is focused on the modular blockchain architecture & value accrual:

**In a modular blockchain stack, which layer should accrue the most value, or should it be about equal between all layers?**

I honestly don’t have an answer for this question, but as scaling efforts ramp up over the next few years I think this’ll be one of the most important things to think through for traders and how to position for it accordingly. Initially, my thought process is that the teams that focus on building really efficient and specialized chains focused on one part of this modular stack will do well, which is why I like zkSync & Celestia a lot as plays later this year.

## personal focuses
need to research POKT
-   **POKT Network**
    
    -   Pocket Network is vitally important Web3 infrastructure that operates as a decentralized relay network for blockchain API requests. Their economic structure is setup to incentivize full node operators by paying them when developers need to use the network to access data for their applications. Many developers need access to high quality read/writes directly from blockchains, but don’t always have access to RPCs specialized for their applications. Pocket describes itself as an “Uber for servers” because you technically don’t know what *server* you will connect to when you query their network but they handle all of the service requests via their blockchain to provide users what they need. As more developers use the Pocket Network, node operators make more money from participating in the network, which in turn incentivizes more node operators to join the network.
        
    -   Pocket Network’s economic system is very clever and it is designed in a way that reduces costs substantially for developers using the network. There are three main functions: staking, minting, and burning POKT. On the application side, you have the ability to put your POKT in escrow while you are using the protocol. For developers, instead of paying fees to a company for some infrastructure-as-a-service, with Pocket Network they can stake POKT up front for access to the network and then use the network until they remove that escrow. Because Pocket Network is not a centralized company that needs to charge fees to cover margin or pay for cloud hosting services, all of this overhead is removed and it is much cheaper for developers. Regarding nodes within the Pocket Network that service developer’s requests, they stake POKT for the right to do work within the network and they will earn a certain amount of POKT for each request that they serve from the application side.
        
    -   I’ve been speculating on ways to capitalize on external non-crypto dev talent joining crypto and this seems like one of the best ways to do that. To me, POKT is one of the most efficient ways to bet on the growth of the builders, users, and speculators within the crypto space. As the community of web3 developers increases, there will be many more web3 applications that need this access to blockchain data, and in turn many more individuals using these applications.

**ATOM**

-   ATOM is the native token of the Cosmos Hub, which connects all of the other blockchains built with the Cosmos SDK through the inter-blockchain communication protocol. One of the main gripes with ATOM is the tokenomics because the focus has largely been on developing Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK for teams to build out their own specialized ecosystems as Cosmos zones. Now, the focus is on connecting all of these ecosystems together and tying that collective value back to the Cosmos Hub. With Interchain Staking, ATOM stakers will not only provide security for the hub, but will also provide security for smaller blockchains connected through IBC; which means that instead of just being paid out in ATOM, stakers will also receive rewards in each of the respective native tokens of each chain

In H1 of this year, Umee, Shade Protocol, and Astroport should be the first major test runs and it’ll be interesting to see how Cosmos DeFi compares to what users have experienced on other EVM chains and Solana.


-   **Aleph.im**
    
    -   Aleph.im is a decentralized distributed cloud platform that offers compute services, file storage, and database hosting. One of the primary use cases for Aleph.im is its’ indexing solution for the Solana blockchain, and it has flown under the radar while building some really strong partnerships. They have partnered with gaming company Ubisoft, to be the storage solution for their first dynamic NFTs in their game Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint. This is one of many collaborations that I think we’ll see in 2022 from AAA gaming companies and crypto builders. Another one of their big partnerships is with the Neon Labs team, which is focused on bringing the EVM to Solana. Neon Labs will use Aleph.im as their indexing solution, to get information on all of the transactions between Ethereum and Solana.

Near ecosystem
-   **NEAR Protocol**
    
    -   NEAR is a sharded proof of stake layer 1 blockchain that is both developer and user-focused with a very strong tech team, and nearly no hype on the media side… yet. What I’ve quickly realized this year is that while I was out partying and not paying any attention to crypto during the bear market of 2018, there were actually a lot of really, really smart people building the technologies that exist today. If you’re anything like me and you found crypto in 2017, then you likely also forgot about crypto when prices went down ~90%, and now here you are trying to get caught up to speed again. So if that’s you then welcome back!
        
    -   Anyways, the biggest difference between NEAR and other chains is their focus on usability, not only for users but also for developers. A large hindrance with onboarding new people to crypto right now is the differences in the user experience: asking people to learn about blockchain tech, managing their private keys, avoiding scams, and navigating to the right websites is a lot to ask the typical non-technically savvy user, which we have seen with the prevalence of BAYC users who keep getting their apes stolen. To do this for the end user, NEAR allows developers to abstract away the confusing parts of interacting with many blockchain dApps by setting up NEAR accounts that: onboard users without them having to choose a wallet each time, enable easy subscriptions for users to manage each app’s permissions, hide costs of infrastructure by allowing devs to pay for usage fees on behalf of users, and provide predictable pricing for transactions. To provide ease of user for new developers: NEAR nodes run WASM which can be compiled from popular languages like RUST, and they provide extensive tooling that makes it easy for developers including one-click deploys, integrated unit testing, and easy front-end integrations + debugging.
        
-   **Aurora**
    
    -   Aurora Engine is a high performance EVM built on the NEAR protocol blockchain. The fees on Aurora are abstracted away from the users and it is easily accessible through the Aurora Bridge and other bridges like Allbridge. Most of the activity on NEAR is on Aurora for now, but I expect that to change with projects that launch following NEAR’s $800M ecosystem fund.
        
-   **Octopus Network**
    
    -   The Octopus Network is a multi-chain network designed to create an interoperable ecosystem of specialized appchains, which utilize the Octopus Network for security. Octo does not have its’ own blockchain, rather it is a set of smart contracts that live within the Octopus Relay on the NEAR blockchain, combined with a set of validator nodes that appchains will pay for security of their application. Its’ structure is similar to that of Polkadot, but it is much less expensive for appchains to bootstrap their networks on Octo than it is for parachains on Polkadot. The plan for each of these appchains is for them to be built with the Substrate framework and a specialized front-end for their application. These appchains will also be IBC-compatible once the implementation of the Substrate-IBC Pallet is complete, as well as being able to communicate with other NEAR tokens as the Octo bridge will deploy a NEP141 wrapper contract for each appchain token.
        
    -   This project is interesting because it fills a specialized niche that I don’t see others executing well yet. If the Octo Network is able to effectively bootstrap many appchains, the $OCT token will benefit greatly from all of these chains needing the shared security of the Octo validator set. Because their ecosystem is designed to function alongside IBC chains, I see a lot of upside here for cohesive multi-chain collaboration. Terra and NEAR have already announced a major partnership, as UST will be integrated within all NEAR & Aurora ecosystems, so it is unsurprising that this relationship will continue to grow in the future.
