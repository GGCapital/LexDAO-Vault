## The thesis!
Japan and the European Union (EU) are both engaging in Yield Curve Control (YCC), either explicitly or implicitly. YCC is when a central bank engages in the price fixing — more commonly known as “manipulation” to us non-central bankers — of government bond yields. The central bank prints fiat currency, and then purchases its own bonds to artificially cap yields where they wish. Remember — when the price of the bond goes up, the yield goes down. This intervention weakens the domestic currency, ceteris paribus.

so what's interesting here is that we have a tight monetary policy now and that in order to loosen said policy, the Fed would actually start printing money once again lol

we enter a recession and then Fed is like oh well now we HAVE to start printing again lets get it aka recession prevention mode

## impact on crypto holders
Quote:
"As crypto holders, the reason we care about YCC is that if/when either of these policy shifts is announced by the US Treasury, or we notice a rising ESF-reported balance, we can then assume that the Fed is actively engaging in printing money to aid the YCC efforts of Japan and the EU. Such activity would be highly inflationary and completely change the global fiat liquidity regime. 

**With more fiat liquidity sloshing through the system, risk assets — which include cryptocurrencies — will find their bottom and quickly begin to recover as investors discover the central bank financial asset market put has been activated.**"

hmmmm so if this is the case, then our goal should be to monitor monetary policy shitfts specifically watching a rise in the ESF balance sheet (how do i find this data)

basically saying that as the Fed starts printing money, thats the signal that folks are going to go back risk on -> leading to this fiat liquidity to enter crypto markets. The US will do what it can to reduce domestic inflation in EU and Japan. when we see printing USD and the Fed purchasing Japanese and EU bonds, or the Fed cutting their Federal Funds rate, that's our headsup that a pivot is beginning.

Each of these circumstances ends up weakening the USD and will add liquidity to a very dry economic environment.

### consulting company example
pretty cool site for a research and consulting company - is that us?
https://www.felixzulauf.com/

example report! honestly very neat and well organized, def what i meant by having official reports
https://www.felixzulauf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/March-23-2020-Minsky-Moment.pdf

he continues by covering governments an dsocial structures that assist in the growth of the society we live in. interesting outlook on the benefits of gov.
basically saying that increase in prod. is where the US gov benefits from their investments in the economy

"So when one unit of debt generates more than one unit of economic output (in the form of a heightened GDP that the government can derive more taxes from), that debt is productive."

the problem here is that the debt load will grow if current economy productivity does not increase. basically grow your economy using the gov's investments, that growth is then taxed by the gov to pay for its investments, and so on and so forth. when that doesnt occur, the gov is in a sticky situation where they start heading down a path toward defaulting

arthur says just inflate away the debt??? so here he's emphasizing that gov should be creating econ activity by spending money on real shit and jobs for ppl to actually benefit from

" Private and public pensions are the easiest pools of capital to rob. That is because the financial regulators can stipulate that a certain percentage of their assets must be invested in government bonds that are designed to lose money in real terms over time."

we see plenty of examples like this where pensions have been used as like cannon fodder

"Exponential maths is apolitical. Exponential debt maths destroys governments with 100% certainty — the only question is how long it will take."

what does this part mean tho?

## Debt Maths Exp
the next section on this regarding how YCC is the last hope for this gov is mad interesting, so is there really no other route to take? haha politicians being the main thing that inflicts pain today to push off the end until tomorrow is wild

when ppl put this shit into crypto that would have an adverse effect on the economy, something is occurring in the nation where ppl are eventually going to put into essence

most interesting example here simply being that we are paying for current services with future performance. units of debt are the services that we provide as well as other products that we create for the greater benefit of the economy at large. 

1.  The population grows such that more activity is generated, and more taxes are paid.
2.  A new technology or energy source is invented or discovered that dramatically increases the productivity of the current stock of workers. This raises the economic potential of society, and by extension, future tax revenues.
3.  The government defaults by:

-   A) Issuing its own currency to nominally pay back the debt, creating inflation in the process.
-   B) Outright cancelling debt via some sort of jubilee

what's most interesting here is how Hayes basically clarifies that the initial two options arent going to work, which leads us to 3A, printing more mula!

we can understand from here that the gov will do what they must to push off the darker present that they have created for us.

## Demographics
funny part here is the fertility rate dropping like a mf while urbanization has been increasing
![](Pasted%20image%2020220901143924.png)

what i really wasnt aware of was just how much of an impact past decisions from like decades ago have an impact on now.

he explains from here that when working age population increases, the country's econ potential grows. this is when gov takes on new debt to help with such growth and to stay in pace with demand. 

the japanese example here being that foreigners still are not brought into the japanese work force even tho they need that shit bad!

![](Pasted%20image%2020220901144552.png)
chandler would love this part regarding the Crusades

## Energy policy
cracks me up that this is all stringent on getting reid of other forms of power, esp when nuclear has the best ROI

very interesting when considering that other countries do not have quick ways to produce energy. even now this is more imminent since these other countries have started relying on Russia for fuel, all to be left behind now bc of the war.

germany now has a trade deficit bc of this, while china has been busy stocking up on discounted energy from russia; ideally we can expect this to have a detrimental effect on the price of goods/services in the EU. america can simply observe and deal with slightly higher food/gas prices in the meantime

![](Pasted%20image%2020220901145923.png)
to comment on later regarding no autocorrect on china

the point of all this is to explain that without purchasing or creating cheap energy, both of these nations economies will be unable to outperform their debt spirals

man so an outright debt cancellation would impact the powerful and wealthy, which ends up hurting plebes in the long run. best option is print money which hurts plebes in short run?

YCC policies are money printing and these countries will be doing so during face-ripping inflation

## Yahweh of Yen
hmm so basic argument here is that the BOJ is completely fine with printing JPY and purchasing JGBs. but having the yield lower than other currencies will hurt eh Yen exchange rate

"As US interest rates rise due to the Fed raising its policy rates, the JPY rate tries to follow– but the BOJ stomps it down to a maximum of 0.25% with its YCC policy. The widening gap results in the JPY weakening."

this part elaborates on just how much of an impact the Fed decisions on interest rates will have Japan's economy and currency. to add onto this, the Yen will be in a worse shape if it has to rely on outside countries for energy. this sticks out the most when comparing prices in Oil,which is now priced at +65% in Yen terms over the past year... OUCH

the article goes on to explain how the BOJ has been doing everything in their power to offset these costs by making Japanese retail spend more. Policy rates have dropped lower and lower, even charging works to save their bread. these banks were then charged by the BOJ to deposit their money with the central bank

Banks borrow short from depositors, and lend long to businesses, which is what the BOJ wants to maintain and keep the banks profitable. 

damn banks fucking suck holy shit. 
![](Pasted%20image%2020220901153155.png)

BOJ has basically created the insane combo of mad high inflation and the lowest value for the Yen in over 30 years

Bank holds no risk in these assets as well ofc ofc

Article goes in even more depth to explain that even the regulators dont know how much risk the banking system is exposed to if interest rates rise...

yo wtf?? what is this shit 2008 all over again?

now in the prev example if you came back to ask for said money from the bank, the bank will tell okay but it'll cost you 18% of the deposit

## **Nothing to See Here**

[“Yellen Shows No Willingness to Consider Intervention for Yen”](https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/REWAZAT0AFB4) — Bloomberg, 12 July 2022

A Treasury-led, Fed-executed intervention to weaken the Dollar against the Yen is exactly what is being considered. This is a trial balloon to see how the market reacts to the possibility that America rides to the rescue of its ally.

Treasury Secretary Yellen and her Japanese counterpart met and discussed many things. But obviously, the most pressing issue for the Japanese is the international value of its currency. If the BOJ is wedded to YCC in order to save its banking system, then the only way to prop up the value of the Yen and reduce import costs is for America to print Dollars to buy Yen.

This scenario is 100% in play regardless of the bold-faced denial, and we shall soon witness the slew of anointed economists debating the merits of such a policy. If the market mummers are favourable, prepare your butts for an intervention.
