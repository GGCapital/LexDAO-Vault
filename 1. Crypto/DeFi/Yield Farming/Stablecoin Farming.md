## Basic principles
https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-stablecoin/

First, let's break down the basic understanding of what a stablecoin actually is. As most cryptocurrencies are often referred to as coins or tokens, a "stable" coin in this industry refers to its value being pegged (attached) to a relatively safe asset class, such as the US Dollar. In doing so, us as users are able to exchange our current fiat money for these stablecoins, to then swap them for other tokens, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. 

Creating this type of opportunity for the average person that may be interested in crypto, provides a comfortable, yet high-yielding asset class for them to take part in. Since the majority of cryptocurrencies are looked at as wildly volatile, stablecoins have taken their mainstay as a balanced allocation for their portfolio as well as creating an alternate savings account for them to take part in without the involvement of intermediary institutions. 

Interestingly enough, stablecoins are seemingly poised to become the most accepted cryptocurrency, differentiating itself from the tokens that crypto-native individuals might rather see. This is mostly due to policy regulations and the institutions behind the largest stablecoins, such as Circle, the financial services company behind USD Coin (USDC), placing themselves at the forefront of politicians and national governments in order to gain the trust and recognition of the global economy.

However, a stablecoin (referred to as stables) such as USDC, is only the base layer of what's possible for investors and new users to take advantage of within this space. One key differentiation between the many current stablecoins we have today, are the assets backing each token. These varieties will eventually grow as more protocols are created and new founders arise with different ideas. For now, I'll cover stables backed by fiat, those supported by cryptocurrency holdings, algorithmic stablecoins, and finally, some of the more recent entrants into this space including derivative-backed stables.

Furthermore, without shilling too many of my bags, I'll go over my favorite protocols to use and some of their best yielding strategies.

### UXD Algo stable
UXD Protocol is an algorithmic stablecoin that is fully backed by a delta-neutral position using derivatives.

UXD is issued on [Solana](https://solana.com), an incredibly fast, cheap, and permissionless blockchain. UXD is a next-generation decentralized stablecoin that integrates with top derivative trading exchanges on Solana in order to create a "delta-neutral" position that collateralizes the stablecoin. Our first derivative dex will be [mango markets](https://mango.markets). Through UXD's construct, we are able to solve the "[stablecoin trilemma](https://multicoin.capital/2021/09/02/solving-the-stablecoin-trilemma/)", allowing UXD to be stable, capital efficient, and decentralized. Moreover, the stablecoin has native yield from the "funding rate" of the perpetual futures position it puts on, allowing UXD stakeholders to generate yield as a result. See [UXD Basics](/uxdprotocol/overview/uxd-basics) for an explanation of concepts like Derivatives, Delta, Perpetual Futures, Funding Rates, etc.

1.  [https://docs.uxd.fi/uxdprotocol/overview/insurance-fund](https://docs.uxd.fi/uxdprotocol/overview/insurance-fund "https://docs.uxd.fi/uxdprotocol/overview/insurance-fund")
    
    UXD's insurance fund exists for the benefit of UXD holders, so that they do not have to pay the negative funding rate from the delta-neutral position, if such negative funding rates occur. The insurance fund may also be used in the case of an exploitative hack that results in undercollateralization of UXD's stablecoin. The insurance fund will be managed by the forthcoming UXP DAO.
    
    In early 2022, UXD completed a research study detailing historical funding rates and what the performance of the insurance fund would have been in various historical market regimes. The results of the study were detailed in the below report: [https://987185596-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-Mj8VWsobdvjhMutae2g%2Fuploads%2FK8B4Qq1s6iS16m2dDiYP%2FInsurance_Fund_Simulation_vF.pdf?alt=media&token=8e79050d-0835-4154-a38c-eddc4fa8b2a9](https://987185596-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-Mj8VWsobdvjhMutae2g%2Fuploads%2FK8B4Qq1s6iS16m2dDiYP%2FInsurance_Fund_Simulation_vF.pdf?alt=media&token=8e79050d-0835-4154-a38c-eddc4fa8b2a9 "https://987185596-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-Mj8VWsobdvjhMutae2g%2Fuploads%2FK8B4Qq1s6iS16m2dDiYP%2FInsurance_Fund_Simulation_vF.pdf?alt=media&token=8e79050d-0835-4154-a38c-eddc4fa8b2a9")

For UXD stablecoin, the potential point of instability is the funding rate. Sustained negative funding rates that cause the insurance fund to deplete could cause UXD to become undercollateralized over time (though, users are allowed to redeem $1 of crypto collateral at any time before this happens).

These properties are strong points for UXD’s stability. In a world with funding rates equal to zero always, UXD would achieve perfect stability. **A strongly mean-reverting, drift-less process is the next best thing.**

-   **A 100% SOLPERP backed UXD receiving 100% of the funding rate would have resulted in the insurance fund growing from $57mm to over $180mm in one year’s time.**
-   **A 100% XBTUSD backed UXD receiving 100% of the funding rate would have resulted in the insurance fund growing from $57mm to over $115mm in one year’s time.**
-   _Note this results in a very conservative estimate: since funding payments are computed as the funding rate times the price of the underlying asset, and because positive (negative) funding rates are generally associated with rising (falling) prices, a constant price assumption understates the size of positive funding payments, and overstates the size of negative funding payments._

UXD will be a multi-collateral stablecoin with various blue-chip assets backing it, such as SOL, BTC, and ETH
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*CRdaWKO6c8a0bj-k7FQ7UQ.png)
**This implies that the primary factor in determining the insurance fund performance is funding rate, rather than asset management performance.**



	
### Dragonfly algo stables
https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/a-visual-explanation-of-algorithmic-stablecoins-9a0c1f0f51a0
#### Notes
Think of each stablecoin protocol as a bank. They each hold assets and owe liabilities. Each of them captures value somehow and distributes that value to “equity” holders.

Haseeb Qureshi explains here how stablecoin projects could be observed of as reserve banks, primarily because each asset held within this bank is matched 1:1 with each liability.

The equity of the bank belongs to shareholders — investors in the bank — and they make money from the fees the bank charges. In Tether’s case, the owners of Tether Ltd. are the shareholders, and their profits come from the [Tether minting and redemption fees](https://tether.to/fees/).

Every liability of a full-reserve bank should maintain a close peg to a dollar, since it’s always redeemable for $1 in reserve. So long as the bank maintains cheap convertibility, [arbitrageurs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrageur.asp) will ensure this effortlessly maintains its peg.

Dai’s peg is currently **stable**.

Notice that the assets in reserve are significantly larger than the total liabilities (Dai). This keeps the whole system secure.

##### algo banks
Algorithmic central bank stablecoins aren’t redeemable at all, and don’t have depositors in the traditional sense. This makes them less like traditional banks and more like central banks. (Central banks tend to use methods other than redeemability to keep prices stable.)

Each algorithmic central bank works in a slightly different way. To analyze an algorithmic central bank, we’ll try to understand what it does in the two important scenarios: when the stablecoin is above the peg, and when the stablecoin is below the peg
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3PAXrLZMQfqebWXMpuoYtw.gif)

Fei functions much like a real central bank, defending its peg directly in the market. Note that Fei is not meaningfully overcollateralized and most of its assets are in crypto. This means that in a black swan event, Fei’s assets could significantly drop below its liabilities and leave it unable to defend its peg

But the net effect is the same: the protocol participates in the open market to push the price toward the peg.

A similar algorithmic central bank is Celo protocol, which produces a stablecoin called Celo Dollar (cUSD). Celo Dollar uses CELO as its reserve collateral (the native asset of the Celo blockchain), along with a [diversified portfolio of other cryptocurrencies](https://celoreserve.org/).

Like FEI, the Celo protocol is continually willing to buy and sell Celo Dollars in the market, using a Uniswap-style market. The Celo reserve was initialized with significant assets in reserve, and the reserve aims to always stay overcollateralized. If Celo’s assets ever dip below 200% of its liabilities, the system attempts to re-capitalize by [collecting transaction fees on CELO transfers](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/stability/tobin-tax).

Like FEI, the Celo protocol is continually willing to buy and sell Celo Dollars in the market, using a Uniswap-style market. The Celo reserve was initialized with significant assets in reserve, and the reserve aims to always stay overcollateralized. If Celo’s assets ever dip below 200% of its liabilities, the system attempts to re-capitalize by [collecting transaction fees on CELO transfers](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/stability/tobin-tax).

Thus, the main difference between Celo and Fei (besides its trading mechanics) are the assets it holds and its rules around collateralization.

A third stablecoin in the same family is [Terra](https://docs.terra.money/stablecoin.html#price-stabilization)’s UST. It is collateralized by Luna, the native token of the Terra blockchain. Like FEI and Celo, the Terra protocol acts as a market maker for the stablecoin. If the stablecoin system runs out of assets, it restocks by inflating the native LUNA supply.

Instead, they market make their own currency in the open market (that is, they are willing to buy or sell across a spread).

This is because **a credible commitment to market making is economically identical to allowing mints and redemptions.**

Imagine a stablecoin, collateralized by ETH. Call them STBL tokens. The protocol is always willing to market make the ETH/STBL pair. This means the protocol will be willing to sell 1 STBL for $1.01 ETH and buy 1 STBL for $0.99 ETH. If STBL is below the peg, it will keep swapping STBLs until its ETH runs out.

If STBL instead uses mints and redemptions, it might let anyone mint 1 STBL for $1.01 of ETH and redeem 1 STBL for $0.99 of ETH. If STBL is below the peg, it will keep redeeming STBLs for ETH until its ETH runs out.

algorithmic market making is different, because smart contracts can make ironclad, self-enforcing commitments. In this light, market making and redeemability are two paths to accomplishing the same goal: providing liquidity and ensuring a tight peg.

### Stablecoin Farms on almost all ecosystems
[https://youtu.be/SQaa13v0FVc](https://youtu.be/SQaa13v0FVc "https://youtu.be/SQaa13v0FVc") 
- great summary to start out with as this gives helpful advice as where to start and how to begin looking at the market from a different perspective
#### rule of thumb
- hold >=10% stables during all market conditions
	- ideally i think you can go a step further and continuously allocate more of trading or investing profits into stablecoin pools and then use the rewards from said pools to pay out investments into newer ecosystems
	- common theme has been new ecos pop up with certain catalysts and those that push past the growing pains of said ecosystem are in a much better space for future growth than those that wait for the coveted FTX/Coinbase listing
- allows giving a consistent yieldon your assets -> doesn't scare users out of markets
- profit taking -> as assets go up -> ppl continue rising in euphoria -> more evident that you should begin taking profit back to stablecoins

| Price of asset | Stablecoin allocation |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| $200           | 10%                   |
| $250           | 15%                   |
| $350           | 25%                   |

#### Key farms
Tricrypto: good for derisking into this pool as a comfy position 
- can treat this like a savings accoutn thru curve finance 
- can also remove liq from this pool easily and ape into projects you're more confident in

frax and fxs: currenlty growing in volume at tremendous speed, can be good to earn on this pool going forward 

### ETH DeFi Stablecoins
tracking eth-defi is important since this is where majority if not all pools have originated from end of the day

#### Convex Finance
https://www.convexfinance.com/stake

mim-ust being the best stablecoin regarding reward payout, excluding other options like frax and mim by itself which also payout in similar yields

- this is truly like a savings account -> deposit here with usdt, btc, and et in 33% allocations
	-  helps derisk going further into the market and he treats it as his savings account
	- very comfy position going forward

Arbitrum has the best outlook for tricrypto as well 14% apr

## Article outline/draft
### What is a Stablecoin?
First, let's break down the basic understanding of what a stablecoin actually is. As most cryptocurrencies are often referred to as coins or tokens, a "stable" coin in this industry refers to its value being pegged (attached) to a relatively safe asset class, such as the US Dollar. In doing so, us as users are able to exchange our current fiat money for these stablecoins, to then swap them for other tokens, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. 

Creating this type of opportunity for the average person that may be interested in crypto, provides a comfortable, yet high-yielding asset class for them to take part in. Since the majority of cryptocurrencies are looked at as wildly volatile, stablecoins have taken their mainstay as a balanced allocation for their portfolio as well as creating an alternate savings account for them to take part in without the involvement of intermediary institutions. 

Interestingly enough, stablecoins are seemingly poised to become the most accepted cryptocurrency, differentiating itself from the tokens that crypto-native individuals might rather see. This is mostly due to policy regulations and the institutions behind the largest stablecoins, such as Circle, the financial services company behind USD Coin (USDC), placing themselves at the forefront of politicians and national governments in order to gain the trust and recognition of the global economy.

However, a stablecoin (referred to as stables) such as USDC, is only the base layer of what's possible for investors and new users to take advantage of within this space. One key differentiation between the many current stablecoins we have today, are the assets backing each token. These varieties will eventually grow as more protocols are created and new founders arise with different ideas. For now, I'll cover stables backed by fiat, those supported by cryptocurrency holdings, algorithmic stablecoins, and finally, some of the more recent entrants into this space including derivative-backed stables.

Furthermore, without shilling too many of my bags, I'll go over my favorite protocols to use and some of their intuitive strategies. Hopefully this will provide a good explainer toward the various assets available for both institutions as well as everyday investors, as well as explain the surprisingly high yields anyone can earn in this space from an almost riskless token.

### Different strokes for different folks
#### Fiat-backed stables
These are the primary form of stablecoins and attempt to control the current volatility of the crypto market by associating their value with the same currency we use everyday, whether that's US Dollars, Euros, Yen, so on and so forth. From an initial perspective, this might seem like a convoluted way of thinking because why would crypto investors who do not want to take part in traditional financial systems remain attached to an inflationary asset like the Dollar? Well at the end of the day, there will always be a need for conservative allocations and overall, the ability to maintain your wealth, which is where stablecoins can provide a beneficial alternative to holding cash in a bank account.

One of the largest growing forms of this type is USDC, a stablecoin created by Circle, with the plan to onboard immense amounts of capital through their organization. As Decrypt explains here, "USDC’s parent company isn’t shy about saying the currency is for those who want to move medium to large amounts. By becoming a more attractive way for institutional investors to get involved, stablecoins like USDC could help make cryptocurrencies more mainstream." This could become a major step forward in embracing this asset class on a wider scale, barring any further detrimental regulation. As stronger connections are built between the real world and this inclusive space, the notion is that wider acceptance will lead to further development and greater opportunities for all crypto users.

Similar to a bank account, the ideal fiat-collateralized stable asset will be backed by a 1:1 ratio such as 1 USDC = 1 USD. This has the purpose of assigning real-world assets to ease anxious investors. With current governments becoming even more responsive to the call for stables within our financial system, companies like Circle and Paxos have the best opportunity at becoming fully regulated and accessible for institutions and users across the world. 

One key moment of this realization came to the forefront during a Senate Committee Hearing regarding the use of stablecoins and their inherent risks. There are many conflicting views presented by current politicians, which is understandable but should be taken into consideration when understanding the wide range of opportunities that these payment systems can provide to any new user. Senators like Pat Toomey and witnesses such as Brian Brooks are prime examples of two groups willing to portray open-minded outlooks toward the inclusion and development of a growing asset class. I highly suggest those interested in understanding this ecosystem and the backgrounds behind them to listen to the full recording here https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/stablecoins-how-do-they-work-how-are-they-used-and-what-are-their-risks.

The tweet threadooor compiled a solid list of their comments here: https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1470775737632370690?s=20

However, as this is still a relatively new asset class, there are still potential downsides to the growth and stability of said stablecoins (ironic isn't it). These include a number of factors, primarily being the misrepresentation of collateral within these institutions possession and the overall centralization of the companies that control these assets' growth and development. It's this problematic differentiation that can cause confusion for newcomers as the assumed notion is that these assets should be accessible, but more so fully transparent to all users. 
![[Pasted image 20220314214214.png]]

In order to truly take advantage of this industry while still participating in the self-custodial nature of cryptocurrencies, this newfound evolution of money has taken a step further to create stables collateralized by other crptocurrencies aka ponzis.

#### Stables backed by ponzis
Although mostly a joke, it can be beneficial to look at all of these tokens as intuitive ponzis (similar to our current banking systems) and simply admire the creativity and efficiency behind some of these protocols. Now assume that you've just spent the past year accumulating your favorite tokens and either have a longterm outlook on their potential profit or want to leverage your current holdings in order to buy more internet money. Thanks to the foundation set by Decentralized Finance (DeFi), users are able to maintain their overall crypto portfolio and collateralize a wide range of their assets to then receive stablecoins in return.

One of the original creations of this strategy was the Maker Protocol https://makerdao.com/en/, created in 2014 with the vision to create a collateralized stablecoin (named DAI) on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain that allows the generation of DAI tokens against ETH collateral. This well-known and commonly adapted system used Vaults to lock up the collateral of any user, which they could then use to borrow DAI. As more DAI became generated and more protocols were built to leverage the growth of this protocol, a new narrative for DeFi was born as now the possibilities became endless for users.

Protocols like Compound https://app.compound.finance/ and Aave https://aave.com/ set the stage for borrowing and lending protocols going forward with a small number of allowed collateral as well as high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. For example, you could deposit 10 ETH (roughly $32.5k at the time of writing) and borrow stables for up to 75% against the current balance of ETH. A very common theme within crypto markets has been.

The next evolution of this came into effect mid-2021 with the birth of Abracadabra and the MIM stablecoin aka Magic Internet Money. 

##### Background on MIM

*Abracadabra your money's gone!* 

This protocol created a new method for backing a stablecoin, through interest-bearing assets, all with the purpose of allowing users to earn yield on their desired tokens, while still being able to use them as a liquid asset. One of the benefits of DeFi protocols is the wide range of strategies anyone is capable of creating with their capital. 

For example, let's say I have some stablecoins sitting in a wallet that I want to put to use. I could take my USDC over to Curve Finance and deposit them into their 3pool https://curve.fi/3pool/deposit (contains a split allocation of DAI, USDC, and USDT) liquidity pool. After depositing my USDC, and/or the other allocated stables, in return I would receive an equal amount of 3pool tokens that represent my deposited balance. 

I could then take these 3pool tokens and stake them on Convex Finance https://www.convexfinance.com/stake to earn additional yield. However, even after all this, I might only be earning 5-10% APR on my stables. Abracadabra adds an additional source of yield here by allowing me to deposit 3pool tokens deposited in convex (cvx3pool) to then borrow against their collateral value.

Once deposited into the cvx3pool https://abracadabra.money/pool/25 here, I could borrow up to 90% of my collateral and receive Magic Internet Money (MIM). When tokens like these listed are collateralized and implemented into the protocol, over time they are minted into more MIM. This allows for formerly illiquid assets to become liquid while users are able to leverage these digital assets with as low risk as possible. From here, the user can take the acquired MIM and either swap them for another yielding asset, explore other yield farms, or simply repeat the same process with their stables (swapping MIM for USDC, depositing back into 3pool, etc). 

To highlight one key factor within this depth of the industry, Abracadabra has unknowingly become placed as an absolute point in the crypto timeline. There are many important characteristics in this protocol that represent specific arguments within the crypto space, including anon developers, cultist leaders, fast-paced communities, and get rich quick schemes. Abra finds itself smack in the middle of all of these, primarily because of an anon dev with a dark and twisted background full of thievery and scams.

What many individuals are now faced with is a decision of who to trust in a space where reliability often isn't determined by past interactions, but by what you accomplish day to day and your actions that follow after. If an individual that once robbed over nine figures from those that "trusted" them, how can one knowingly participate in future business with them? In our case as the viewers of this situation, how can we then trust the individual that trusts that robber? Seems as if a cleanse needs to happen doesn't it lol

So you can protect from a pool squeeze or a depeg through a market, and that's kind of what is there on FTX's UST-PERP. You are basically paying a funding rate either for a prediction of a depeg or for downside protection risk. Right now that rate is a whopping 500%+ APY

A third variety of stablecoin, known as an algorithmic stablecoin, isn’t collateralized at all; instead, coins are either burned or created to keep the coin’s value in line with the target price. Let’s say the stablecoin drops from the target price of $1 to $0.75. The algorithm will automatically burn a tranche of coins to introduce more scarcity, pushing up the price of the stablecoin. This type of stablecoin protocol is difficult to get right and has been [tried and has failed](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-stablecoin/) several times over [recent years](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-stablecoin/). Yet, entrepreneurs [keep trying](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-stablecoin/).

The final addition among stablecoin categories would take us to non-collateralized or algorithmic stablecoins. Non-collateralized or algorithmic stablecoins do not have any assets or collateral for backing them. So, how are algorithmic stablecoins classified as stablecoins when they don’t have any collateral for backing them up?

The non-collateralized or algorithmic stablecoins follow an algorithm for controlling the stablecoin supply. Such a type of approach is also known as seignorage shares. With the rise in demand, new stablecoins will be created to reduce the price to the normal level. In event of considerably low coin trading, coins on the market are purchased up for reducing circulating supply. 

Basically, algorithmic stablecoins could offer stability according to the tenets of market supply and demand. In addition, it is also important to note that algorithmic stablecoins feature the highest level of [decentralization](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-for-government/) and independence. On the other hand, such algorithmic [types of blockchain](https://101blockchains.com/types-of-blockchain/) depend on continual growth for ensuring success. You should know that there is no collateral involved with algorithmic stablecoins for liquidity, and everyone can lose their money in case of a crash.

Now that we've gone over some of the background's behind each type of stablecoin and their inherent risks, let's dive into some of our go-to stablecoin farms. Hopefully this can help weather the impending storm of FUD and bad prices that the current crypto market has been plagued with.

**Disclaimer: the majority of these stable farms are still just as risky as any other protocols. Please be aware of this before allocating any large amounts of capital as even the most trusted examples can & will fail in your time of need**
