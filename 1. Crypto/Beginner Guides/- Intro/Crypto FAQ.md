**CRYPTO FAQ**

**- [ ]  What is Blockchain?**

**- [ ]  The blockchain is similar to a permanent book of records that keeps a log of all transactions that have taken place in chronological order.**
Let’s envision a bank transaction in which there are three parties: the sender, the bank, and the recipient. In order to ensure that there are no fraudulent transactions, the bank acts as the central authority between the parties.

**- [ ]  The blockchain also logs transactions between senders and receivers**, except there is no bank or central authority. Instead, the blockchain relies on a public network of computers to verify the transaction. The blockchain is just an accurate, and permanent record of all the transactions that have happened amongst the members in that blockchain’s network. In this analogy, each block in the blockchain represents a transaction, and each transaction is connected to the prior transaction to form the entire connected blockchain.

**- [ ]  Key Terms:**

**- [ ]  Block:** A block is an individual transaction or piece of data that is being stored within the blockchain.

**Blockchain:** A blockchain is a continuously growing list (“chain”) of records (“block”), called blocks, which are linked chronologically and secured using cryptography.

- Determining the legality of cryptocurrency within your jurisdiction is important.
- in order to begin, you must have a "wallet".
    - this can be on multiple blockchain networks, such as Exodus wallet. y
    - Another alternative is you can choose a blockchain-specific network to hold their range of assets: Solana blockchain → use Phantom wallet

- There is the common risk of using outside sources for holding your cryptocurrencies, such as an exchange like FTX or Binance.
    - This will require you to fully trust the security of the exchange as you will most likely need to set up an account with your personal information
        - There are methods of avoiding this, but they entail their own risks and do not need to be written about when dealing with large sums of capital.

    - However, you are placing your assets on a platform that could be shut down or hacked to access your information.
- The alternative and the route that I prescribe for holding the majority of your crypto hosts will be through self-custody. This will mostly entail companies or executive level figures to bypass any identification requirements from outside sources in order to have access to a higher level of security depending on the level of software or hardware they choose to use.

- The fact of the matter is that most institutions usually end up going with outside sources for holding crypto assets, especially those that may lack the knowledge of the space.
    - The downside to this is the vast amount of trust that must be placed in the exchange or custodian, which is why it is important to maintain to full control of your assets and primarily, your private key.

- Your private key, held with a desktop app or "hot" wallet and a hardware device such as Trezor called a "cold" wallet, will be the only thing between you and your crypto. As you initially build up a portfolio of cryptocurrencies, I highly recommend investing into a cold wallet that you keep in a safe, as this is the best route to securing your crypto since it is not connected to the internet.

    - The ideal route is to maintain a written version of this key held within a safe or deposit box for security purposes.
    - One alternative is a multi-sig wallet, used by professionals for applying multiple keys in order to transfer assets.
