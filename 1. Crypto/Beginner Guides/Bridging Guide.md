How do I Get Funds onto Avalanche?

BRIDGING METHOD
Step 1: Setup your Metamask wallet with the Avalanche network: https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4626956-how-do-i-set-up-metamask-on-avalanche
Step 2: - Go to the Avax bridge https://bridge.avax.network/
Step 3: - Connect your Ethereum Metamask wallet and ensure that you have around $30+ worth of ETH for gas fees
Step 4: - You can bridge USDT, WETH, USDC and other coins over to the Avalanche network. Keep in mind that USDT will become USDT.e on Avalanche, WETH will become WETH.e, USDC will become USDC.e and so on.
*Note: all bridging transactions over $75 will receive a small AVAX airdrop to cover initial swap fees. *


EXCHANGE METHOD 
Step 1: Step 1: Setup your Metamask wallet with the Avalanche network: https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4626956-how-do-i-set-up-metamask-on-avalanche
Step 2: Withdraw AVAX from Binance or any other supported exchange using the AVAX C-CHAIN network. Send the AVAX to your Metamask wallet address beginning with '0x'
Note: Do not use the 'Avalanche' network in Binance - this is only for X chain withdrawals which are only relevant to those running delegator and validator nodes
