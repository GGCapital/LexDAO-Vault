How do I get started?
I'd say anywhere from 0.25Ξ - 1Ξ is a good amount to start with. Less is possible, but that's probably the safest amount to assure you don't get priced out of a drop.

Some drops can be short notice, due to there being so much going on in the space currently, so it's good practice to have funds available at any given moment. Drops will be posted in nft-drops moving forward.

Also, being on the computer is 1000x easier than using Metamask or a wallet on your phone. You can still try using mobile, but it will lower your chances at success.


Funding your Wallet
I personally use Blockfolio to buy ETH and/or celsius wallet to send into my Metamask. This can also be used to cash out ETH into your bank account.

Where to sell
All NFT's put in #nft-drops can be sold via https://opensea.io/. Think of this as the eBay of NFT's.


What is Gas/Gwei?
Gas is what is used to send a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. The more transactions that are being sent at one time, means the network gets congested and gas prices go up. Transactions that are willing to pay more gas, are prioritized first. So if you pay more gas, it's more expensive but your transaction goes through quicker. If you don't pay enough gas, your transaction will be pending until the other transactions who paid more gas go through first. Which means the drop may sell out before your transaction goes through.

What is a hardware wallet?
A hardware wallet is a device (most of the time a bit larger than a usb drive) that secures your assets by requiring interaction with the device to transact on the network. You should have one if there are any NFT's you decide to hold on to, or if you have large amounts of money in crypto.
