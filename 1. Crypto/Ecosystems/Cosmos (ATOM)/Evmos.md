# Evmos & composability
#defi #ggportfolio 

## Background
`EVMOS will be the first IBC enabled EVM blockchain, built with Cosmos SDK and Tendermint as the consensus engine. This will allow new _and_ existing EVM applications to integrate with Cosmos`

Evmos will be a sovereign application-specific chain that will be interoperable with Ethereum, EVM-compatible environments, and other [BFT](https://tokens-economy.gitbook.io/consensus/chain-based-pbft-and-bft-based-proof-of-stake) chains via IBC, making it easy for users and developers to move between them. But the vision expands beyond that too, as Evmos plans to support the development of application-specific chains that utilize the [Ethermint library](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint) (scalable and interoperable Ethereum library that can create PoS chains with fast-finality using the Cosmos SDK)**.**

Evmos enables:
-   EVM compatibility
-   High throughput via Tendermint's Consensus Engine
-   Horizontal scalability via IBC (performance increases by adding more nodes)
-   Fast transaction finality
