# ZkSync Testnet

## Initial Protocols

For zksync there's a good amount of new protocols to try out, most evident has been zigzag and mute. There's still high chance for airdrops so easiest process is to set up wallets and start trading.

## Onboarding Alpha

Can also refer to the onboarding alpha breakdown they provided. This displays their roadmap and overall outlook for each stage of ZkSync:

## Protocols I've Used

here are some notes on what i've done so far, hopefully will result in yummy airdrops for @Farmer @Researcher 
(@GuttaAlmighty#2868 @AhkDon#3380 peep and lmk what im missing)

Initial signup can just be going their wallet page and either using the twitter faucet or your alchemy account:
https://wallet.zksync.io/account/
Faucet:
https://portal.zksync.io/faucet
Block explorer:
https://zksync2-testnet.zkscan.io/

First I'd say just start on their ecosystem page and then work on down thru each category:
https://ecosystem.zksync.io/

They explained current milestones recently here:
https://blog.matter-labs.io/baby-alpha-has-arrived-5b10798bc623

so far i've played a bit of teveara, bought karma and created some accounts. played the teva quest game and picked up some points. then went to mint their "guardian" nfts 
https://testnet.tevaera.com/dashboard/app

used a few faucets to get other tokens for mute, swapped for eth/btc/dai/mute, added to a few liquidity pools, then staked mute/eth lp into their amplifier pool
https://testnet.switch.mute.io/

went to mint square and made some offers (purchase doesnt work), then minted some random gif. will probably create a collection to see what that's like too
Site:
https://mintsquare.io/zksync-testnet

have used zigzag in the past for their testnet but revisited to just make some random trades on mainnet (noticed they're on arbitrum nitro too)
https://trade.zigzag.exchange/?market=ETH-USDC&network=zksync

wanted to use trustless finance but their demo is down, just glanced at their docs and will see what the protocol actually looks like in practice (not really sure what their stablecoin will amount to in relation to governance)
Site:
https://www.trustless.fi/
Demo:
https://zksync.trustless.fi/
Docs:
https://trustlessfi.notion.site/Trustless-4be753d947b040a89a46998eca90b2c9

used mes protocol and their faucet to start up a trading account, made some more trades on their eth and usdt spot market, but they're on nitro and optimism goerli as well so want to see what the "cross-rollup mode" is like (site is shit tho)
Site:
https://app.mesprotocol.com/spot/ETH-USDC
Faucet:
https://faucet.mesprotocol.com/

wanted to use syncswap but for some reason the zksync rpc doesnt work or there were some connection issues? i remember this happening awhile back too, so not sure but ignored for now and i'll just revisit another time
https://syncswap.xyz/

also noticed spacefi, thought it was interesting they're connected to evmos but its supposed to be an all-in-one type of platform for connecting cosmos to l2 chains
https://app.spacefi.io/#/home

main questions i have for now are what's different for zksync (from a user perspective) compared to other rollups, esp if same protocols will be launching there with few alternatives.
