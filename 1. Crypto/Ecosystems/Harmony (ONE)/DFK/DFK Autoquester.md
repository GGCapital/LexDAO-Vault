git clone https://github.com/SansegoTek/DFKQuestRunner.git
ran this inside vs code![[Pasted image 20220107132325.png]]
so far setup is good and npm install worked better within vs code
now will need to see how to setup with new burner wallet then can send my foragers over there to test out first

`PS C:\Users\yan22\GG Capital\Bots\DFKQuestRunner-main\DFKQuestRunner-main> npm install
npm WARN read-shrinkwrap This version of npm is compatible with lockfileVersion@1, but package-lock.json was generated for lockfileVersion@2. I'll try to do my best with it!
added 44 packages from 4 contributors and audited 44 packages in 7.126s

31 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities`

now tried running wallet and address and got nothing
technically is already installed tho hmmm

## commands
- ran cd to find folder
- ran `cd __`
- installed using the "code" feature on github -> unzipped file -> opened in vs code
- opened terminal with cmd
	- `npm install` to install into the vile
	- confirmed that there are 31 packages found
	- now need to go to src folder -> create pk.txt file

for the private key, i'll create a burner and then place this within the pk.txt file and then use src/pk.txt so that the wallet path will pull private key from there

thsi will make the process simpler looks like![[Pasted image 20220107134009.png]]
