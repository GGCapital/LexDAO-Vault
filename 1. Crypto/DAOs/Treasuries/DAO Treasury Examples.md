### DAO Summary

-   Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are organizations that are fully democratically managed by their community members, in a trustless and transparent way, to help achieve a common mission.
-   BitDAO is a new treasury that focuses on the mass adoption of crypto across the world
    -   Suggestions for growth:
    -   Collaboration with crypto projects: BitDAO plans to launch token swaps with existing and emerging DeFi projects and support them with R&D resources, liquidity, funding and co-development opportunities. The goal is to accelerate BitDAO partners to become category leaders. BitDAO will hold tokens of partner projects and is incentivized to support their success.
    -   Building out various DeFi products: BitDAO also intends to launch various DeFi products of its own, including a decentralized version of Bybit’s crypto futures exchange, a portal for the community to propose token swaps with promising early-stage projects, and programmatic implementations for governance and treasury management.
    -   Growth with Bybit: Bybit is one of the world’s fastest-growing derivatives exchanges, with over 1 million users and over 88% growth in trading volume between Q4 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021. Bybit is the earliest supporter of BitDAO and plans to advance its mission by allocating 2.5 basis points of its trading volume (~$258M in Q1 of 2021) to the BitDAO treasury and supporting the various R&D efforts of the DAO.
-   Basing governance off of the native token would be key in almost any DAO structure, but can have different purposes with this
    -   can start off with one token = one vote
    -   or just build up the community by saying each member only gets one vote
-   Ideally want to become like this:
    -   Through initiatives like token swaps and grant awards, the democratically governed and massively well-funded treasury is uniquely situated to boost early-stage projects and foster key synergies across various products and protocols, propelling DeFi towards a more open, collaborative, and meritocratic future.

### DAO Primer

DAOs are member-owned communities with a flat organizational structure, where everyone has equal access to voting and decision-making within the DAO.

Each section of the DAO should be entirely decentralized as that is what results in a successful and transparent protocol. I should be able to participate from anywhere in the world no matter who I am.

In order to keep things decentralized, the majority of these projects tend to use smart contracts to confirm and execute proposals, token shares, and overall decision-making. Each vote is determined by the group and there is no ability for one person to unilaterally change the DAOs objective or rules

This mostly prioritizes the people supporting the crypto community which is what's most important in this day and age → providing a method for people to collaborate and develop projects in an open-source environment with the capital necessary to truly succeed.

### DAO Strategies

-   **Research & Development:** BitDAO partners will establish R&D centers to develop BitDAO core protocols (governance and treasury management), develop BitDAO DeFi products, support DeFi partners, and provide incubation services to emerging DeFi projects. BitDAO affiliated R&D centers could employ hundreds of people in the coming years.
-   **Liquidity:** With its treasury, BitDAO will control one of the largest pools of DeFi assets, which can be used to provide liquidity to partner protocols. BitDAO can bootstrap new platforms such as DEXes, lending protocols, and synthetic assets.
-   **Funding**: BitDAO will support new blockchain technologies through grants (like Gitcoin), and DeFi projects through token swaps.

The supply of BIT is fixed at a total of 10 billion tokens, of which approximately:

-   30% will be held by the treasury to facilitate ecosystem swaps
-   5% will be distributed via a private sale
-   5% will be offered as rewards to launch partners
-   60% will be allocated to Bybit to establish R&D centers to support BitDAO and to support Bybit growth (which in turn grows the BitDAO treasury). 15% will be immediately available for use, while the remaining 45% will be locked for a 1 year cliff, after which they are vested linearly over 2 years.
