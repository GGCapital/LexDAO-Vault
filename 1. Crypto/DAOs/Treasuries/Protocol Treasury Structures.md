## Keynotes

Protocol treasuries need to be structured with an infinite time horizon. This requires thinking effectively about:

-   Fiscal policy: how much to spend and what to spend on
-   Asset allocation: how the treasury should be diversified to fund key protocol development irrespective of the market environment
-   Reporting: financial statements of the treasury and summary of key transactions

## Principles of Treasury Management

Infinite time horizon

-   The treasury should be structured to exist in perpetuity.
-   There should be no time preference, i.e. no preference given to funding present projects over future ones.

Inflows should exceed outflows

-   Over the long-run, the returns of the treasury (inflows) should be greater than the spending rate (expenses/value of treasury) + inflation rate.
-   The treasury’s purchasing power should be maintained or grown after accounting for expenses.

Diversified asset allocation

-   The assets in the treasury should be diversified and aligned with the goals of the community.
-   Besides the protocol's governance token, there should be a portion of the treasury in liquid blue chip assets (e.g. ETH, BTC), stablecoins (e.g. DAI, USDC), and other assets.

Having a diversified fund would have its benefits in bear markets as we can allocate accordingly to each sector

-   rotating from metaverse to defi
-   allocating more to nfts as btc starts to range
-   this allows for structuring with an infinite time horizon
    -   infinite time → rotate to whats hot and has best future roi

## Fiscal Policy

Base this off of protocol needs and the treasury size

-   fee revenue: budget should be less than expected revenue
-   viewing each area as funding and providing for future development
    -   how can we help the ecosystem grow even more?
    -   $1m grants sent out to projects or building up sections of the DAO

the main needs of a protocol are:

-   Protocol and parameter development
-   Code audits
-   Business development and integrations
-   Advertising and sponsorships
-   Hackathons
-   Bounties
-   Miscellaneous improvements

## Asset Allocation

Only the governance token? Not a good look since you're relying the entier balance sheet on one token (treasuries that have 50%+ of one token, that's too big of a bet on the success unless you're starting your own defi protocol

-   A protocol's treasury should be diversified over time.
-   Diversification should be planned based on the treasury’s expected annual outflows, liquidity needs, and risk-return of assets.

Sample allocation

-   Protocol’s token
-   Stablecoins (DAI, USDC, etc.), a portion of which earn yield. Stablecoin allocation depends on the liquidity needs and treasury budget.
-   Blue chip crypto assets (BTC, ETH)
-   DeFi index (DPI)
-   Early-stage token investments and M&A that improve the protocol's competitive positioning. The [discussion](https://twitter.com/mhluongo/status/1368963503663513606?s=19) between Keep and NuCyphur is an example of what an on-chain merger could look like.
-   Insurance cover and options. [Example](https://twitter.com/sanlsrni/status/1367724652970221569): rolling buys of smart contract cover or short-dated puts on the protocol’s tokens. This could benefit the protocol during Black Swan events like contract hacks, economic exploits, and market drawdowns.

Token buybacks can also be a key part of the DAO in a defi sense, think just having a reserve stablecoin asset that's earning on multiple platforms for airdrop potential is a good plan for this

-   [TokenSets](https://www.tokensets.com/) for customized index-like ERC20 portfolios
-   [Enzyme](https://enzyme.finance/) and [dHedge](https://www.dhedge.org/) for on-chain funds
-   [Potion Labs](https://potion.fi/#/) for risk management architecture
-   [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/) for yield optimization

## How can we diversify the protocol's treasuries?

Sell the gov. tokens and buy back majors or another projects token as an attempt to even out holdings as well as make partnerships

-   Spell & Mim example where daniele starts buying ohm as a bribe to switch to mim as a stablecoin
-   selling large amounts of gov tokens would be negatively perceived
    -   would need to ease around this and not try to dump on followers
    -   majority of this would be decided by the community tho

treasury could also receive other crypto assets as inflows. Few methods include:

-   Earn fee revenue in other assets that accrues to the treasury.
-   Earn other tokens in exchange for value added by the protocol in other cryptonetworks.
-   Set up yield delegation vaults: i.e. pay the protocol’s tokens (e.g. UNI) to Yearn users for them to delegate a portion of their yield in ETH and stablecoins to the protocol treasury. Rally [experimented](https://medium.com/rallynetwork/introducing-yield-delegating-vaults-f861a11afb0b) with yield delegation vaults.
-   Invest in early-stage projects or do M&A that improves the protocol’s competitive positioning.

## Who would handle the treasury?

Ideally you would want to set up a committee, of course each budget allocation would be decided on by the group, but the treasurers would maintain the closest relation/understanding to the current fund balance

-   Propose treasury budget to discuss and vote on
-   Define liquidity requirements based on budget
-   Decide asset allocation policy and review this policy allocation every month
-   Define policy for liquidity mining, token buybacks, salaries and vesting schedule of core contributors
-   Publish monthly / quarterly financial statements
-   Publish monthly / quarterly reports on how treasury is spent

The treasury committee can be voted on and removed by token holders.
