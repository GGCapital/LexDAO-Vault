## Questions about the subject

-   What are the different strategies new DeFi can use?
-   Who are key examples of these strategies?
-   What are the requirements for dealing with large amounts of capital and taking out large loans?

## Reading notes

-   a DAO is a headless org that runs on the basis of instruction given by code, governed thru on-chain interaction

Their treasuries are all a delicate balance between native tokens, underlying infrastructure like Eth and defi protocols in exchange for collateral

1.  Selling assets in the public markets may signal a lack of confidence and cause a collapse in the asset price. Some protocols get around this through reaching private agreements with venture capital firms. However, this may not be genuinely fitting in the ethos of community-based governance.
    
2.  The other angle they may take is to make a public announcement on which the community votes. These could get rather messy as we recently saw with Sushi. The community may not form the consensus needed to initiate such an agreement meaningfully fast enough.
    

More importantly, many large organisations would rather avoid the scrutiny altogether and buy the asset from the public markets. Due to a mix of the two, some of the largest DAO treasuries remain concentrated on very few assets with directional exposure. The graph below shows the percentage distribution of prominent DAO treasuries in dollar terms.

-   The goal is to optimize for longevity and be anti-fragile to ensure operational deployment and development funds even in bear markets.

### Strategies to allocate assets

Scenario: Treasuries holding stablecoins, diversified indices, and other on-chain structured yield products to provide operating capital without having a distress sale in an already weakened market.

Personal favorite: using treasury assets or the native token itself as token collateral to provide additional capital for investments and other ventures

Scenario: Treasuries availing on-chain loans against token collateral to provide operational capital without needing to sell tokens upfront.

> Protocols can borrow from on-chain lenders to access funds for operational expenses without selling any native tokens. It protects the network from a short-term sale of the assets. If deployed as intended, the funds will lead to positive outcomes and justify the repayment even with a sale of tokens down the line. The underlying idea here is that if one genuinely believes a protocol will rise in price over time, it makes more sense to take a loan against it. The challenge is with relation to collateral ratios. If a lending protocol (or venture) sees the asset trending lower in price, they have good reason to sell the tokens to maintain the necessary collateral ratio. More importantly, if a hack takes down the protocol and price slips fast, any entity that has offered the loan could find itself in the red. Protocols could also use off-chain lending to generate yield. DAOs could liquidate part of their treasury to stablecoins and offer to projects like Centrifuge to do real-life lending. This still requires them liquidating an amount of the tokens they hold.

Great opportunity here to explain different borrowing strategies that you can partake in, especially when considering each sector of crypto that you have access to. For example, the whole rotation concept of crypto is incredibly prominent and often reoccurring. As of now, we've had what seems like multiple cycles all within the same year, sometimes cycles within a cycle! One common rotation that we've seen on many occasions is the rotation from majors (BTC, ETH) down to prominent alts or blue chips (the most recent example had L1's taking full control with Solana, Avalanche, and others) or following a narrative, which can either be consumer-related or where the majority of capital is heading to (China cracking down on crypto exchanges and money heading to DeFi).

Range tokens is another example that I actually do not have any knowledge on but it seems like an interesting strategy to basically take out additional collateral against the native token but instead placing a bet on the overall wealth within the treasury

> The range token enables a DAO to use its native token as collateral to borrow funds. At maturity, if the debt is not paid, the range token holder is instead compensated with an equivalent amount of the collateral (the native token) using the settlement price of the native token to determine the number of tokens. For example, if the native token is trading at $25 at settlement, a 100 USDC debt would be settled with 4 tokens (100 / 25)
