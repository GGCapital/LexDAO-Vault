## DAO - Background

Reasonings for establishing a DAO

Given that we are a community, and as such there is value that exists for being a part of it. It is given that the value of the community is not intrinsic, and is in fact created through individual actors' collaboration. A DAO is an efficient and reliable way to in some capacity assess this value, while also acknowledging contributions. It also allows a community to anonymously and collectively work towards a goal (or goals) in confidence. From a macro perspective, we are already participants in a Metaverse, and are in fact a community of people vying for internet leverage not only individually, but as a group. A DAO allows us to concentrate this energy on specific objectives as a community. An example (for our purposes) in the traditional world is an investment group or hedge fund. A metaverse example is a Guild in an MMO. The idea is to leverage individual skills and proficiencies to provide a better community for all, to create real value. Because of this, active community participants are incentivized. Facilitates collaboration. Important Because the utility of this group is focused around building capital, I propose we tokenize membership and do not distribute tokens with a financial structure. ie 1 token per participant that simply shows they are part, allows voting Even more important is how to best provide security and preserve anonymity for all members . On this, I am open to suggestions. As multiple files stun shared suggest, it is possible to collect info on members through a shared 'web' of transactions, thus allowing for vulnerabilities (mainly financial) and targeting. Propose that although we may exist under the TBT name, the wallets and or/ens we are actually using have absolutely nothing related to it. Propose discretionary use of tools like tornado and wasabi wallet (and/or monero) when moving relatively large amounts of capital to and from the DAO wallets Propose that members use wallets not associated with any other activity Propose that DAO members can be removed (if need) with full proposal and deliberation process (to be decided upon) Propose that additional fundraise can be done utilizing works from members of the DAO as they have macro benefit to gain both individually and through the DAO

start with a small amount of capital contribution from members to establish functionality of systems and work out effective flow model Additional projects or activities can be used to add value to DAO, but do not require all member participation. minimum member requirements, sign ups after vote, etc Tools all of which can be set up live 9/5/2021 Discord for communication Aragon for infrastructure. Reputation based voting (colony) has potential flaws and DAOstack is primarily focused on the development of DApps Snapshot for voting (aragon has voting mechanisms as well) Gnosissafe (if applicable) for additional multisigs Questions to answer 9/5/21 all of which can be decided on 9/5/21 type of governing structure: ie: vote delegation, voting mechanism, proposal mechanism minimum deliberation process for proposals proposal outline, minimal requirements etc how to combat apathy and maintain engagement Starting capital Distribution of capital for DAO activity Initial DAO activities Initial Goal (time to analyze results) exits (aragon provides tools) Outline off chain-rules and procedures before on chain use how many votes are required to pass proposals security/anonymity standards opening up DAO to remaining members of TBT Financial implications there is no evidence that DAOs have considered being subject to various requirements under the tax code requires international cooperation and innovation and it is difficult for tax administrators to find out who should tax a DAO income the "company" exists on the internet, which effectively has shared jurisdiction and thus requires shared solutions potential tax issues come from individuals use of capital extracted from DAO Potential projects creation of dashboards tracking progress utilization/creation of various tools to assist in DAO activities (ie nansen, glassnode) Later creation & funding of large scale community DAOs for projects ie sushi, the lao, pleasrdao, etc
