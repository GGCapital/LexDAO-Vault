# Tracking Lido Investors
#defi #analytics 

Here's the initial summary of token splits and confirmation from team (best reference is the intro lido article here https://blog.lido.fi/introducing-ldo/):

Founding members are also distributed LDO, with the respective amounts: 221,800,000 LDO for investors, 65,000,000 LDO for validators and signature holders, 200,000,000 LDO for initial Lido developers, and 150,000,000 LDO for founders and future employees. They will have their LDO tokens unlocked on December 17, 2021, followed by a one year vesting period. These restrictions apply to developers, validators, investors, founders and employees

okay so time to go thru all of the lido dumps and old investors that are now fully vested. I find these pretty interesting enough as you can simply check back on the initial lido deployers and crunchbase to cross check which funds/holders still hold lido and which ones have already dumped their investment. Most of this is based off the aragon token manager from lido which can be found here [https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xf73a1260d222f447210581DDf212D915c09a3249](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xf73a1260d222f447210581DDf212D915c09a3249 "https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xf73a1260d222f447210581DDf212D915c09a3249")
initial interest came from this set of tweets as well as seeing how much lido rallied over the past week or so. [https://twitter.com/mhonkasalo/status/1606314343263453184?s=46&t=Rt7q-Z0PUks8ImQGC_pC3w](https://twitter.com/mhonkasalo/status/1606314343263453184?s=46&t=Rt7q-Z0PUks8ImQGC_pC3w "https://twitter.com/mhonkasalo/status/1606314343263453184?s=46&t=Rt7q-Z0PUks8ImQGC_pC3w") 

This tweet for large holders helped find some old sellers that were also on the token manager list. [https://twitter.com/OuroborosCap8/status/1561656074620391424?s=20&t=RIWT3W9AMdjKqKx35UrN-g](https://twitter.com/OuroborosCap8/status/1561656074620391424?s=20&t=RIWT3W9AMdjKqKx35UrN-g "https://twitter.com/OuroborosCap8/status/1561656074620391424?s=20&t=RIWT3W9AMdjKqKx35UrN-g") 
The first wallet from this thread is 0x1f3813fe7ace2a33585f1438215c7f42832fb7b3. It's on the token manager list and sold in august, still has 16m left. main wallet to watch and was largest whale from this investment round. 

They received roughly 30m in LDO from token manager, with half left they seem to be rather long term focused [https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0x1f3813fE7ace2a33585F1438215C7F42832FB7B3](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0x1f3813fE7ace2a33585F1438215C7F42832FB7B3 "https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0x1f3813fE7ace2a33585F1438215C7F42832FB7B3") 
Next one is 0x43adde52c6c142912662d3e427709db5cac9b811, which is potentially blocktower as top counterparty with majority of large txs interacting with bt capital wallets (could either just be a whale or another blocktower wallet to add to entity) [https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/tx/0xbeca6ab2d9a63b5a059f0fd4e4c53d01d5c773c6662526fb379aa720674f60b8](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/tx/0xbeca6ab2d9a63b5a059f0fd4e4c53d01d5c773c6662526fb379aa720674f60b8 "https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/tx/0xbeca6ab2d9a63b5a059f0fd4e4c53d01d5c773c6662526fb379aa720674f60b8") very active in defi in general, tracing back to yfi and snx purchases [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfe4d881992185dc94a2975ee24abdb554f468eb0e1176da6bd8ef85ff1671755](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfe4d881992185dc94a2975ee24abdb554f468eb0e1176da6bd8ef85ff1671755 "https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfe4d881992185dc94a2975ee24abdb554f468eb0e1176da6bd8ef85ff1671755") Final 

one is 0xa67f3fcd86f5c274aaf5aa6279ca88e84f4e0479 not as important but still a defi user with good access to early protocols (added to a defi power users entity [https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xa67f3fcd86f5c274aaf5aa6279ca88e84f4e0479](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xa67f3fcd86f5c274aaf5aa6279ca88e84f4e0479 "https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xa67f3fcd86f5c274aaf5aa6279ca88e84f4e0479")) 

will continue with rest of the token manager list shortly, here's the deployer i'm basing this off of [https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/tx/0x06c10f98d32cdbe8633c967aabd52c87a5469d7c79399719e673a8ed18b6a7b3](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/tx/0x06c10f98d32cdbe8633c967aabd52c87a5469d7c79399719e673a8ed18b6a7b3 "https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/tx/0x06c10f98d32cdbe8633c967aabd52c87a5469d7c79399719e673a8ed18b6a7b3")

This is the initial dashboard (work in progress) and contains each of these key investors along with the explorer for tracking ldo sells within the entity itself. there's still a few more that I need to add from token manager list but this covers at least the main investors excluding a16z and digital currency group from the crunchbase filings [https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/dashboard/82f00a64-8cf8-4a71-9af4-9ad900dd67f7](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/dashboard/82f00a64-8cf8-4a71-9af4-9ad900dd67f7 "https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/dashboard/82f00a64-8cf8-4a71-9af4-9ad900dd67f7")

Lido dao financials is an interesting dashboard to use here as well

Random but additional alameda wallets to see
0x489a8756c18c0b8b24ec2a2b9ff3d4d447f79bec 
0x9695cfaa368718dd6790a6f57b633d83f565893e

Okay restarting this now!

Here we have the Deployer 1 address for Lido
0x55Bc991b2edF3DDb4c520B222bE4F378418ff0fA

Okay plus when visualizing the lido investors entity, I can see what all of these entities were doing with their LDO after receiving.

whew man holy shit look at this visual here!
https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/visualizer/0fc9c535-4742-446e-9c6e-432a7c0b1903

From what we can see here, the main takeaway is

Also see the benefit of checking discord, dao bots like the one lido has and referring back to initial token proposals. in this case, seeing a wallet is a lot of transactions between the token manager and the treasury but no labelling, a simple copy-paste reveals that 0x489 is the Vesting Manager address that the DAO had previously voted on

Here's the example tx for Dragonfly, process follows: Vesting Manager->Aragon Token Manager->Dragonfly

Haha okay I lucked out!! Found a new Flipside page for tracking these wallets and I notice most are simply listed as the top holders.
0x9Bb75183646e2A0DC855498bacD72b769AE6ceD3 for example has 20m but hasnt really sold any
https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/top-ldo-holders-6zUlxG

Dude does a good job of at least labeling some of these, I can provide a bit more background on them as well
![](Pasted%20image%2020221229224908.png)

Now finding out that more of these wallets are Team and Early Investors
https://discordapp.com/channels/761182643269795850/877627215636992160/1041886668061429810

Most interesting is that these ppl came in with 25m ldo already, maybe sent to symbolic as a market maker or it really is symbolic dumping bags
![](Pasted%20image%2020221229230102.png)

Maybe not symbolic, would make more sense it's just an early investor
![](Pasted%20image%2020221229230604.png)

I'm not sure what wallet is but will check back later
https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xa824b4a89E92599C276a9cE3B75600121D6bbC57

Wormhole Contract deployer has 20m LDO? Were they part of early investors? Or maybe to bridge to solana?
0x447f95026107aaed7472A0470931e689f51e0e42
Nah cus this was all sent to sushiswap and then recently sent to binance deposit??? Lol 4m LDO that's gotta be wormhole or maybe jump right??

What I want to add to the dashboard:

Having the VC/INvestors at the top next to the explorer
Having the Token manager below this, starting with ttreasury and airdrop address, then filling in the other early investors/individuals that participated in funding

**Signing off and will pick up in morning!!!**
