# Safe Wallets

Looking at current Safe wallets and how to manage them. 

## DyDx Safe
For example the DyDx safe is what's used to send funds to dydx for trading, I would connect via wallet connect to gnosis safe and use the Owner Wallet and Signer Wallet to confirm transactions on the Safe for funding.

Owner Wallet ->
                                 DyDx Safe ->    DyDx Account
Signer Wallet ->

This basically describes the process for adding funds, then would work in reverse for sending funds back to the safe (much simpler since it's just withdrawing from DyDx to the DyDx Safe)
