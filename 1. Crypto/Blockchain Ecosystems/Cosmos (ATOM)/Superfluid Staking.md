important to setup how to value the LP share chain should update auto with the changing in price -> gotta use twap not spot price (esp historical twap, solana comes in handy here) are the lp shares just there chilling? -> throw the lp shares and toss it into the community pool (setup similar to like a mngo juice pool?) what's the IL here? 

treat is as 2x collateral ratio -> econ value thats used as a buffer now try and generalize with any defi protocol, most important would be seeing it work with staking derivs
