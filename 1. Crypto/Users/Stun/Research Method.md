# Stun's Method for Viewing Crypto

-   **Research the team**: Almost every company has succeeded because of the execution of a great team. Usually that's people with great business acumen. In crypto, this is a team of great developers.
-   **Browse the Discord**: The Discord community acts as a way to see how devs organize the community that believes in their product. If you see a discord that's unorganized or lacking information, chances are the developers are as well.
-   **Use the product**: The brilliant thing about crypto is that every project has a usable product that you can try out. See if you like the product, see if others like the product. See if it solves a problem. See if it's fun.
-   **Check the tokenomics**: A project could have a great product and a great team but if the token emissions allow 4m in tokens to be released every week (I believe Step Finance did this but eventually discontinued it seeing the price was getting crushed).
-   **Audit the code yourself**: This one could be a more daunting task given studying several large codebases could take a great amount of time from your day. This could still be rewarding because:
    -   You can figure out if the code will rug you just by reading it
    -   A lot of projects are forks anyways so studying the main project code (Uniswap, Serum, Olympus) could make reading other projects easier
    -   You will learn exactly how applications work
-   **Spend time on-chain**: The biggest rewards in crypto are from investing early into promising products. The only time to find great products before others is to spend time searching and testing newly released products.
